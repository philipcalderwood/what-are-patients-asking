cervical,Question,L2025,Radical hysterectomy: pre-op appointment with surgeon,"
Hi everyone,
I had my initial pre-op appointment with the surgeon today. He explained more about my diagnosis, surgery and what to expect afterwards, giving me the opportunity to ask questions and checking that I understood along the way. A very helpful meeting where I felt listened to and well cared for.
I will be having an open radical hysterectomy with fallopian tubes, ovaries and lymph nodes also removed as a precaution. I have been told to expect to be in hospital for 4 or 5 days after surgery. 
I have an appointment next week for pre-op health checks and to meet the recovery team for info and advice then I’ll have another blood test 2 or 3 days before surgery. I’m awaiting confirmation of the surgery date - the surgeon said that it will be in February but not the first week of February as he is already fully booked that week. So it shouldn’t be long to wait for surgery - the sooner it takes place then the sooner I can start recovery. 
If anyone has any tips/experience to share, that would be much appreciated. All general tips/experience welcomed - below are a few things I would particularly like to ask about if anyone is able to help.

Things to take with me to the hospital that I might not think of (I’ve never stayed in hospital before but I have looked up general things to take like nighties, day clothes, etc).
Anything that you found you couldn’t do after surgery while recovering that you hadn’t anticipated/expected in advance (I’m trying to think about anything I can prepare/put in place before surgery that will make it easier afterwards). 
Did anyone else need to be able to step over the side of the bath to access the shower once at home (I only have a shower over the bath, no shower cubicle)? If so, did you manage this okay in the first few days/weeks of being back home? 

Thanks,
Louise

cervical,Question,Auslov,Recent Hysterectomy after repeated high grade cell changes.  Discovers 3 cm cancer hidden within Cervix,"
Hello, just a little background on me.  I had my first bad pap in 2018 with high grade cell changes and HPV positive. I have had three lletz procedures over the last six years with the doctors suggesting a hysterectomy after the last procedure still finding high grade cell changes. 
The hysterectomy went well and everything appeared normal but I have been told that after pathology they detected a 3cm cancer hidden deep within the cervix and unfortunate it had a positive margin.  I asked what stage it was and was told it was 1B. 
I am now awaiting details about a potential larger test to identify any remaining cells and they have said because of the positive margin I will need a five week radiotherapy course with light chemo. 
I am really scared and was wondering if anyone had any similar experiences they could share, what next steps could look like etc.  Also, is there a chance they could discover more?  The doctor said it was a real surprise to everyone and that my tubes and other areas looked completely fine.  
Thanks so much

cervical,Question,SJBC36,"New here. Colposcopy-no punch biopsy, straight to treatment under general anaesthetic.","
Hi,
Would anyone know what I should be expecting with regards to treatment and recovery please.
A bit of background history…
My smears have been abnormal since 2019, have always shown high risk HPV. I have been having them yearly since. I had my first colposcopy which showed borderline changes. Then had another a year later which showed low grade and then most recently another showed high grade. Results were high risk HPV and HSIL - high grade dyskaryosis. 
I was referred as urgent and saw a consultant oncologist on Thursday. I went in expecting and preparing for the worst case scenario would be a LLETZ there and then. Non of the leaflets prepare you for anything other than this. 
He literally started to have a look and highlight the areas. He then said I can’t treat you today it’s far too wide spread and goes up somewhere? Can’t remember exactly.
His assistant asked if he was taking a punch biopsy and he said no, straight to treatment.
I have to go in to have a Cone Biopsy, a LLETZ and a Top Hat under general anaesthetic. 
I’m not sure what to make of it all and what the recovery will be like? Do I need time off work etc? 
I was a bit taken aback and unfortunately didn’t ask any questions. Other than I can expect a call from his secretary, I have no information to prepare or will this come in the post? Any similar experiences? 
Thanks in advance for any info!

Hi i am 2.5 wpo, i had a RAH and have been recovering ok albeit slowly. However on Monday i started getting hip pain, a real boring pain that stops me from sleeping. i'm currently only on paracetomol and 1 or 2 ibuprofen but these dont touch it, maybe slightly take the edge off. So i rang the nurse today but as its still early days all she could suggest was more ibuprofen and maybe some gentle hip stretches. However, i found out after the call that the blood thinner injections i'm still on say i shouldnt take ibuprofen with them. So now its 3am, i cant sleep and the pain is unbearable, i've tried icing but not much help. It did go off today for abit but seems to be worse in bed. Obviously tried researching to find the cause but it seems its a common problem after hysto. Interested to hear others experiences or suggestions, thanks x

Hi 
I’ve just finished 6 rounds of paxital and carboltian .
I’ve just started rads this week with cisplatin .
I’ve been feeling fine etc but my bloods taken day prior to chemo showed very low neutrophils and low blood count . I’ve been told chemo delayed but rads still going ahead . I’ve got to have injections and blood transfusion to help with blood work .

Hi 
I’ve just finished 6 rounds of paxital and carboltian .
I’ve just started rads this week with cisplatin .
I’ve been feeling fine etc but my bloods taken day prior to chemo showed very low neutrophils and low blood count . I’ve been told chemo delayed but rads still going ahead . I’ve got to have injections and blood transfusion to help with blood work .
Has anyone else had this problem? And did it take long to resolve so can commence chemo .

cervical,Question,Martha24,Preventative Treatment,"
Hi, 
Following a LLETZ procedure I had a call from my consultant to confirm that the part removed was cancer. I’ve since had an MRI, x-Ray and blood tests and am awaiting results. The consultant said that depending on these results will be looking at treatment or preventative measures and when I asked what the preventative measure meant she said a hysterectomy. 
I’ve been quite optimistic (maybe naively so) through the whole journey so far however I think reading some posts it’s dawning on me that the hysterectomy may not be the end of the line.  
I just wanted to see if in general there are answers to the following: 
after the hysterectomy would I still be monitored for any cancer for a period of time? Or would I just be discharged?
has anyone had a hysterectomy and then treatment rather than the other way round? I think this will depend on the test results I get?
thank you so much.

cervical,Question,Lorzy321,Radical Hysterectomy,"
Hi all I hope everyone is keeping as well as possible , I’m just wondering if anyone could possibly answer a couple of questions my CNS is away till the 27th.
i had my radical hysterectomy on the 2/1 I am recovering well good and bad days but nothing I wouldn’t expect. I haven’t had any discharge or bleeding except for day 1 had a little bleeding when I stood up for the first time - I was told to maybe expect a gush (a little like weeing myself) after a week or so if I haven’t have any discharge or bleeding and this hasn’t happened yet ? Is that normal ?

also I am back to see the surgeon next week he explained after surgery that one of my lymph nodes looked “suspicious “ and was pretty enlarged - he’s hoping it’s just reactive but we’ll know more next week when I see him -
all going well and the lymph nodes/tissues come back clear does this mean I get told I am cancer free or do I need to go for further scans to confirm this. Thanks everyone in advance and if anyone needs or wants to ask me any questions in regards to the RH I will happily answer and support you as much as I can

Hi,
I've been having some troubling symptoms for around 5 months. Irregular bleeding and some mild pain. I have had a ca125 test (normal) and an ultrasound, which was 'suggestive of adenomyosis' and endometrium of 11mm. My last smear a year ago was hpv negative, although I bled during and the nurse commented there was 'something' there, but was 'probably an erosion'. However, I had cin3 many years ago and Lletz treatment. 
I was referred to gynaecology 5 months ago and still don't have an appointment. My worry is that the bleeding is now heavier and lasts longer, sometimes a week of no bleeding, then starts again. I get daily period type cramps and some backache.
Caveat, I'm 44 years old, had my hormone levels checked and was told they were ok, but i do feel fobbed off as menopausal. I'm also a palliative care nurse

cervical,Question,Squizzy27,"Coil appointment, found lump on my cervix.","
Hi, 
I had a planned coil fitting 2 days ago, I was also due a smear so had it. 
The doctor struggled, it was uncomfortable and they gave me an anaesthetic spray.
The doctor had to abandoned the coil attempt as she found a lump/ growth on my cervix, it was bleeding as she touched it and it took a little while to stop bleeding.

The GP and nurse’s behaviour changed, asking loads of questions, apologising for adding to my health issue.

Asking if I have support st home, can I attended an appointment in the next 2 weeks as it is very important I get to it.
I asked if she thinks it could be a polyp, her answer was guarded. She said “Well, its not. Typical looking polyp but I suppose it could be”.
Been referred urgently for the 2-week suspected cancer appointment. I'm now worried that it is cervical cancer, the notes she left on my file are quite negative.
I had an internal scan last July which showed I have fibroids in my uterus.
If the lump had been there as they went into my uterus would it have been seen them?
Fingers crossed it isn't anything and I'm cancer free but I also am thinking do I just have a hysterectomy anyway because of my fibroids, extreme bleeding and this growth whatever it may be if non-cancerous.
Any advice? Or help greatly received. 
Thank you.

cervical,Question,LOO1,Stage 4b diagnosis,"
Hi,
I found out I have stage 4b cervical cancer this week. Mind is just racing and im fluctuating between anger, denial, despair.
on December 16th I had an appointment with gynaecologist as I had been having bleeding between periods and more severe period pains, they found a 5cm tumour on my cervix. I was then quickly referred to a hospital where I underwent biopsy, MRI scan and PET -CT scan. These scans have now confirmed it has spread to lymph nodes, from pelvic region to the para aortic lymph nodes and all the way to the left subra clavicle lymph node (below my collar bone)
doctors are saying I need ‘radical’ treatment. They haven’t done this treatment combo on others before. 
im starting chemo this coming Monday, weekly induction chemo for 6 weeks. Carboplatin and paclitaxel.
Doctor said I could use cold cap (at my own expense) so I will try that.
following the induction chemo I will go on chemo radiation combo for 6-7 weeks. Cisplatin. And possibly immunotherapy (they are still to complete the PDL 1 inhibitor test from the biopsy sample), if that indicates that immunotherapy may work they’ll put me on that as well, radiation will be external beam for approx 30 sessions and then some brachytherapy as well. Then targeted radiation to the collarbone lymph node.
I’m just in shock, I’m only 40 years old, I was feeling fine, always been healthy and now this.
i think I just need some encouraging words, maybe someone with similar diagnosis to tell me about their journey. Maybe someone has had ‘radical treatment’ before?

cervical,Question,starfire,Feeling anxious waiting for colposcopy results,"
Hi everyone,

I’m 24 (soon to be 25!) and feeling really anxious at the moment.

I had a colposcopy on 5.12.2024 as my smear test showed low grade dyskaryosis and high risk HPV. I was totally fine with going for a colposcopy as I know a lot of people who have had one and it turned out to be nothing, and I had a great experience with really caring staff.

The doctor mentioned he suspected the changes on my cervix were more moderate/severe than indicated by my smear, I’m assuming he’s querying CIN2/3 rather than CIN1. So he took a couple of biopsies. He mentioned my case may be discussed at the MDT and that results may take longer than usual (3-4 week average at my local trust).

It’s now 6.1.2025. On Thursday it will have been 5 weeks since my colposcopy, and I haven’t heard anything at all. Not even a letter to say my case is definitely going to MDT and this is why my results are delayed.

cervical,Question,starfire,Feeling anxious waiting for colposcopy results,"
Hi everyone,

I’m 24 (soon to be 25!) and feeling really anxious at the moment.

I had a colposcopy on 5.12.2024 as my smear test showed low grade dyskaryosis and high risk HPV. I was totally fine with going for a colposcopy as I know a lot of people who have had one and it turned out to be nothing, and I had a great experience with really caring staff.

The doctor mentioned he suspected the changes on my cervix were more moderate/severe than indicated by my smear, I’m assuming he’s querying CIN2/3 rather than CIN1. So he took a couple of biopsies. He mentioned my case may be discussed at the MDT and that results may take longer than usual (3-4 week average at my local trust).

It’s now 6.1.2025. On Thursday it will have been 5 weeks since my colposcopy, and I haven’t heard anything at all. Not even a letter to say my case is definitely going to MDT and this is why my results are delayed. I have also changed GPs as I moved house around the time I had my colposcopy (silly me!) and they’re being quite slow with granting me full access to my NHS app which doesn’t help. If I could go on there and see if any letters have been uploaded, it would be such a weight off my mind, but I’m stuck in limbo.

cervical,Question,Janene123,Cervical or uterine? So confused and scared,"
Hi all

im 52, started my periods when I was 11 and went through the menopause at 38. My period just stopped and never returned. Until about 6 months ago when I started bleeding quite heavy. I had a low pelvic and back pain, pain when I urinate even though all tests there even ultrasound is clear. I can barely eat without feeling full and bloated. So I went to my gp. 
she fast tracked me to gynaecology and I had a ultrasound and my womb lung was just slightly above normal. I also had a smear with came back high risk hpv with borderline changes. At the time they tried to do a punch biopsy from my uterus several times which nearly killed me but were unsuccessful. They decided to send me away with some oestrogen cream to be inserted for dryness and review in a year for another smear. 
fast forward to now. I’m still bleeding. The pains are worse. I’m now constipated too. My bladder has lost all control. And hurts. Mr dr referred my back again to fast tracked gynea. They did another smear which came back again with high risk hpv but this time I had now moved up to low grade changes. I also had a scan and my womb lining had also increased by 1.5. 
ithey initially took a biopsy and sent me home with some hrt pessaries. But this with I had a call to say to stop the treatment immediately and I now have to have a colposcopy and a histeroscopy. Both fast tracked. 
I am so scared. I don’t know what they are thinking, why stop the treatment? 
I feel so alone

cervical,Question,Kapow,LLETZ Procedure! Very Scared!,"
Hey everyone, I'm a 30 year old new mother and I had abnormal bleeding in 2022, I had a smear and it came back as abnormal cells. I was referred for a colposcopy which came back as okay and was told to attend my normal smear in 3 years.
Fast forward to May 2024 after I've had my little girl and my implant refitted after giving birth and the bleeding started again. I put it off for a bit as the bleeding was on and off and thought it may be to do with my new implant. Finally in October 2024 I went private to see a gyno who did an examination and said she couldn't see anything but also did a smear just in case.
I never heard back so assumed the smear came back fine (silly me didn't follow up with having a new baby and life getting in the way!)
Fast forward again to today (January 2nd 2025) and I get a call from the gyno saying they finally received my results and I'm now high risk and needs a LLETZ procedure next week. She said she wasn't worried its cancer but I should get the procedure done ASAP.
I'm absolutely terrified I've got cancer as the bleeding is definitely a symptom and the results took months to come back which has obviously delayed treatment. I've got an 8 month old little girl and I am so scared that I'm going to end up dying and leaving her. My mum had to have a radical hysterectomy when she was 38 and so i am so scared that I'm at a later stage of the cancer and won't be able to be cured.
Just looking for some words of reassurance!

cervical,Question,From the flames,Have  you had the new more successful chemo regime?,"
Hi all, did you see the news recently about the Interlace trial which is using already existing treatment with a diffferent delivery pattern which achieves a 35% higher success rate for cervical cancer. 
You have an induction course of 6 weeks of chemotherapy (carbo/taxel) then straight into chemo(cisplatin)/radio for 5 weeks. This was my regime then 2 weeks of brachytherapy.  
I do remember my consultant saying there was new research and because of it, I would be having the maximum treatment they can give. My stage was 2B. 
Is this the usual treatment plan that everyone has? I feel so lucky that on my last MRI, just after radio/chemo finished, the consultant and radiographer could not see any trace of the tumor. I’m wondering if it could be partly contributed to the induction chemo?

cervical,Question,Lorna45,Hysterectomy and follow up,"
I was diagnosed with stage 1 cervical cancer Sept 2023 after abnormal smear and LLETZ.
I had a 2nd LLETZ Nov 2023 which showed only precancerous cells. This resulted in a full hysterectomy Feb 2024 due to there being no clear margin in both LLETZ.
Menopause has been bearable so far with little to no symptoms.
I had a smear test in Aug (6 months post op) and this showed further abnormalities, with a biopsy being taken Nov. My consultant advised she could see white cells which could be cancer or an infection (i should say I've had high risk positive HPV on all smears recently)
I'm worried that the cancer is coming back just as I feel like life is returning to some sort of normality. Has anyone had this before? Surely a recurrence wouldn't be that quick?

So I just got back from my pre op altho I still dont have a date yet but prob early Jan. I saw the anaesthetist who was nice enough but was talking really fast as though he was rushing through the consultation, he then did a risk assessment on me which i think was meant to be reassuring but wasnt! i was just hoping for someone calm and who would give me confidence tbh, he might not be my anaesthetist on the day anyway. Then a nurse went through everything with me and it all just sounds like such a major surgery-which i already know it is but now i feel like its an even bigger hurdle to get through and i feel so scared because so many things can go wrong! i thought hysto was my preferred option but now it feels like its going to be such a trauma to my mind and body and i might still have to go through radiotherapy if pathology isnt clear! please tell me this is normal and most people feel like this! i will never forgivr myself for missing that one smear test because now i have to go through all this and worry about cancer the rest of my life!! sorry gor the rant but am really struggling today

cervical,Question,Seffie,Hysterectomy pre op-more anxious now!,"
So I just got back from my pre op altho I still dont have a date yet but prob early Jan. I saw the anaesthetist who was nice enough but was talking really fast as though he was rushing through the consultation, he then did a risk assessment on me which i think was meant to be reassuring but wasnt! i was just hoping for someone calm and who would give me confidence tbh, he might not be my anaesthetist on the day anyway. Then a nurse went through everything with me and it all just sounds like such a major surgery-which i already know it is but now i feel like its an even bigger hurdle to get through and i feel so scared because so many things can go wrong! i thought hysto was my preferred option but now it feels like its going to be such a trauma to my mind and body and i might still have to go through radiotherapy if pathology isnt clear! please tell me this is normal and most people feel like this! i will never forgivr myself for missing that one smear test because now i have to go through all this and worry about cancer the rest of my life!! sorry gor the rant but am really struggling today

cervical,Question,cold feet,CIN 3,"
Hi, 
I am looking for a bit of guidance.
I had CIN 2 about 12 years ago and was treated successfully for this.
This year I was found to have CIN 2 on smear but when I had the treatment for that episode I was found to have Cin3 with changes to the cells further up the cervix.
I have had a further treatment today however I was advised that if the margins were not clear it is unlikely that I would be offered lletz again as I had now had it 3 times and that I would be looking at a hysterectomy.
The colposcopist was keen to emphasise that the cells were CIN3 not cancer but in the same breath said that it is likely this would be the preferred treatment.
Can I ask is there anyone else who has had more that 3 lletz treatments, and indeed is hysterectomy always the next step?
Thanks in advance

I have this week found out that a biopsy taken at my recent colposcopy appointment is positive and that I have cervical cancer. It’s all happened really quickly and I’ve been told today that my MRI results show that it hasn’t spread (which I’m taking as great news) and that it’s been graded as 2a2. 
I’m having a pet scan tomorrow then will find out my treatment plan but my cancer nurse says I’m looking at chemotherapy, radiotherapy and quite possibly a hysterectomy.

cervical,Question,Mandymoo76,Copper coil and pelvic radiotherapy,"
I was diagnosed with stage 2A cervical cancer in Feb, started Chemoradiation in May, had brachytherapy in July and have just been given the all clear.
During my appointment with the oncologist, he mentioned trying to remove my coil during each of the 3 insertions of the rods for the brachytherapy, but not being able to as it was “stuck” and that they are referring me to gyno. They mentioned removing my coil many times prior to this, during treatment but never did. 
Has anyone ever had issues like this before? I sure as hell don’t want anyone else poking around down there as it’s still so tender and if my consultant couldn’t remove it while I was under general I really don’t want them to try while I’m awake.
i know this is slightly off topic but if anyone has had anything similar or heard or anything I’d love to know about it.

cervical,Question,IOS,Confused about CIN3 result,"
I recently had a Colposcopy following a smear test where abnormal cells were discovered. I also have HPV which I have had for about 5 years.  During the Colposcopy I had Lletz treatment to remove the cells and was told I would probably need another treatment under general anaesthetic due to the abnormal cells being quite high up and not reachable. I have just received the results and it says CIN3 and I need a follow up test of cure in 6 months time where they will test again for HPV.
Why do I need to wait for 6 months to test again for HPV when the results of the Colposcopy are CIN3? 
If HPV is still present in 6 months surely I will just have another Colposcopy to check for CIN3 so why can't I just have it now rather than wait. The Lletz treatment I have just had won't get rid of the HPV will it? 
I am just a bit confused and don't like the idea of waiting for that long only to go through the same again.
Hopefully you can put my mind at rest and clear things up a little bit for me.

However I keep getting pain in Lower back, swollen groin (where lymph nodes where) and now I’m in a constant state of paranoia and anxiety thinking they have got it all wrong and in fact some of the cells were left and spreading. I literally can’t get this thought out my head. I have spoken with my macmillan nurse and they just give me reassurance but I am convienced they are wrong. My whole treatment from diagnosis to discharge seemed so quick. Which I know is proactive and a good thing but I also can’t help feeling something was missed. Does anyone have similar hearth anxiety and overthinking like me and if so what helped? I want to keep speaking with the hospital team but they know I suffer from anxiety and I feel they don’t take me seriously. Is there any particular symptoms I should look out for if something has been missed.

Hey, just wanted to check if anyone else has had a similar experience.
I had a colposcopy with biopsies taken 5 days ago and have had bleeding on & off since, sometimes bright red, sometimes brown. I know bleeding is perfectly normal after cervical biopsies but every time I have a bowel movement (TMI, sorry) I experience heavier, bright red bleeding. I had colposcopy with biopsies 2 years ago and never experienced this so I’m worried the cervix isn’t healing like it should.

Hello everyone,
I’m new on here and just wondering if anyone could help me out maybe any positive stories or amwhst to expect. Would appreciate all honesty too X 

In May 2024 I was referred to oncology team & had an MRI as was having symptoms such as bleeding, pro longed heavy periods etc. 
The MRI shown a large mass which they said ‘likely represents a cervical fibroroid but recommended a biopsy’. However, oncology was confident that no biopsy needed and I was referred to benign gynaecology. 
however, by July I was presenting with extreme bleeeing gushing when using toilet loosing blood clots. I presented at emergency gynaecology sometimes 2 a week. I was given prostap injections, hormone medication, Tranexamic acid ( for 4 months) received blood transfusions etc. 
as a result on 4/10 I was given a full hysterectomy. After surgery I have now just been told that I didn’t have a fibroid but I had a 7 cm tumour aggressive grade 3. They made a mistake!!!!
I a m in total shock, upset, scared etc I am awaiting further tests to see if spread. I have just been told that the surgeon had no idea, everything surrounding was reported as normal and no bulky nodes. However, apparently this cancer can spread by blood vessels. 
im so scared as this has been inside me for so long as I was told it was a fibroid. 
Can this cancer of been contained & not spread? 
thank you sorry it’s a long post just very anxious! Xx

cervical,Question,Hooch,Persistent HPV and cell changes,"
Hi all
i am currently freaking out - it’s going to be a long weekend…
I have had HPV for 4 years in a row - first time had CIN 1, checked one year later and had CIN3 so had Leetz.
Smear last year no CIN but HPV.
fast forward to this year - had smear on 10th October, hospital rang on 17th October and have asked me to go in this Monday to colposcopy.  The nurse was unable to tell me any other details.  I rang my doctors the same day and they didn’t have the results.  Rang them yesterday and the doctor hadn’t reviewed but the receptionist did say she could read it to me.  Said grade 4? Googled it (obv) and it appears that is code for severe cell changes.
Has anyone else had a similar experience? So many questions! Why can’t I clear HPV? Why do the cell changes change so quick? Will I be offered hysterectomy?
Any advice, sharing of similar experiences appreciated ️

Hi all, 
Just wanted to reach out to anybody that has been through a similar situation to myself… 
I was diagnosed with 1b1 then downgraded to 1a1 adenocarcinoma of cervix nearly a year ago.
i have had several procedures; LLETZ, cone biopsy and hysteroscopy. they said my last LLETZ that the margins were clear. 
i have now been left with the decision of conservative management (smear every 6 months-year) or a hysterectomy. I am single, 36 with no children and they are referring me to a gynae counsellor to discuss what a hysterectomy would mean for me. i did plan for children but i am now thinking my life currently is more important at the moment and the anxiety will get to me with the worry if the cancer has returned. 
I am worried about the ‘watch and wait’ approach, as I never had symptoms prior to my diagnosis, the cancer was not picked up through smear it was only picked up when they did a biopsy. a hysterectomy is a tough decision as i do not have children but i feel this would cause me less anxiety. I worry every new symptom or pain will cause me anxiety. 
I know it is ultimately my decision but, any thoughts?

Safe to wait another year, This time my cervical screening results have come back with hpv High risk and cell changes (no surprise) although what did surprise me was the colposcopy appointment letter that came with that. Normally i would have quite a wait for the colposcopy but this time my appointment is 4 days. My cervical screening results did take around 8 weeks to come back! I have been reading around and maybe scared myself a little seeing the appointment is so soon. Wondering if anyone had the same experience and what the reason for that was?

cervical,Question,CoraK,Will it ever end?,"
Hi all
I’m mostly here to ask some questions and to hopefully ease my mind.
2018 I had a smear with HPV but no cell changes. 2019 follow up I had HPV with cell changes. Colposcopy letter said it showed CIN1 but at the appointment she said there was a small pocket of CIN2 as well. They wanted to do cold coag (from memory) but I asked for a wait and see approach as I’d read that some percentage of people can have their cells revert, particularly if the HPV is cleared.
Can’t remember if follow up was six month or a year later but it came back clear and no HPV. I was put back on the three yearly usual smear checks.
Just had that done and was quite surprised to see the results came back positive for HPV and with cell changes again. So I’m waiting on another colposcopy which they said would be in the next few weeks.
I’ve been through this before so in one sense I’m not worried. But I’m worried about the HPV. As it has recurred (unlikely it’s a new infection). And both times I’ve had it I had cell changes. So what happens in the long run? Is this going to be chasing me forever? My body doesn’t seem to be able to get rid of it. And seems to be easily damaged by it. If I have a procedure to remove cell changes I have plenty more cells for the HPV to harm. Like when does it end? Did anyone else feel this way? Am I being too pessimistic? I just don’t want to keep worrying about this forever. I’m worried this time the results will be worse. But it’s more the long term that concerns me than the immediate investigations.

Adenocarcinoma 1A2/1B1 diagnosis","
Hello All,

I have been diagnosed with Adenocarcinoma the Dr has said it’s likely stage 1A2-stage 1B1 following MR scan and recommended hysterectomy as no plans for further children.

Background
I am 38 years old with 1 child and I have had clear smears until HPV detected 2022 and HPV with abnormal cells 2023. These were confirmed as glandular changes.

LLETZ procedure completed in nov 2023 which confirmed CIN3 which confused me as no glandular changes noted in biopsy histology (was advised this was rechecked and confirmed no glandular changes). My follow up smear July 2024 confirmed further glandular changes and further LLETZ needed. This confirmed cancerous cells and referred for MR scan last week.

MDT meeting advised hysterectomy although possible removal may have already occurred but due to infection and inflammation they couldn’t confirm for sure on MR scan and due to no preference for more children hysterectomy recommended.

Please can anyone advise if they have had a similar situation. I’m really worried things may have been missed and keep googling reoccurrence at stage 1b1 adenocarcinoma after hysterectomy and it’s frightening me.

Thank you xx

cervical,Question,DebDebW,Cervical cancer stage 4a,"
Hi everyone. I found out I had cervical cancer stage 4a about 2 months ago. In that time I have had two chemotherapy treatments, 3 weeks apart. Cisplatin and paclitaxel. I am due to meet my oncologist on the 16th. She said if she can feel my tumor has shrunk we can go with one more course of the two chemotherapy treatments together. Then move on to 5 weeks of radiotherapy (every day for 5 weeks) combined with one week dose of Cisplatin (5 more of those altogether). Obviously I'm not ungrateful. She wants to do this so the bulk of my treatment has finished before Christmas. But, I feel like it may be a rush just to push it through. I'm stage 4a. It's in my bladder, lymph nodes..... Does this seem like a rush to anyone else? Many other women my stage have 6 chemotherapy treatments before they can even consider moving on to radiotherapy. I'm genuinely scared right now. Also, does that mean an agonising wait over Christmas not knowing if it's working or now? The wait is excruciating......

cervical,Question,Meme85,Chemoradiation - side effects,"
Hi everyone.
its been a while since I last posted.  I had a radical hysterectomy on the 15th August. My recovery has gone really well. On Wednesday (6 weeks post op), my consultant rang with with biopsy results.
My surgical staging is 1B3 squamous cell carcinoma. She removed 18 lymph nodes on the left and 24 on the right. Thankfully all of them came back clear.
However, she said I had LVSI in the tumour (cancer cells spreading into the blood vessels in the tumour).  So I have to 5 weeks of radiotherapy as preventative treatment. She said that I would possibly also need chemotherapy but this was still being reviewed.
I have an appointment with my new oncology doctor on Tuesday, and I’ll have a lot of questions for him. In my mind, the fact that the MDT are even discussing the possibility of my having chemo means I should have it! I don’t want the risk of reoccurrence.
There are a few things I am really concerned about, and I was hoping for honest feedback.
1/ Menopause and managing it quickly (I still have my ovaries)
2/ My sex life never being the same again due to the radiotherapy damaging my vagina.
3/ Hair loss from chemotherapy. Will I lose my hair?
4/ Lymphoedema. I’ve had a lot of nodes already removed and haven’t had an issue. I’m worried that the radiotherapy will massively increase the chance of me getting this.
I really appreciate you taking the time to read my post and to let me know what your own experience of chemoradiation has been like.

cervical,Question,Vix128,2 Week Wait Worry,"
Hello, 
I'm new to this forum and hoping for some insight as I wait for a 2WW appointment to see a gynacological consultant. I went to my GP last week to talk about some discomfort during sex that I attributed to perimenopause but when she examined me she found a small <1cm ulcer in my transformation zone on my cervix which bled when swabbed. She explained that due to this being present she would refer me to be checked for cervical cancer. 
I'm up to date with my smears, never had a unusual HPV result and my last test in Easter last year was normal. I have no bleeding, discharge or any other symptoms except the pain I described above.  
Needless to say I'm freaking out about the referral and despite telling myself there's lots of things this could be, it could also be the worst thing I can imagine and I'm struggling.   
I have my appointment on 3rd October and wondering what I can expect from this appointment? I have no info yet on what tests and scans it will involve. Could anyone share any experiences of similar referrals and whether the consultant is able to offer any info there and then - or will I have weeks of further waiting for biopsy results?

Hello all, I’ve just recently joined this group for a bit of guidance.
last year I had a smear in June, I didn’t receive any results from this so gave the doctor a call in January when I remember and the receptionist was a little allusive and paused then said ‘everything was fine’, June comes round again and I get called for another which I found strange but went anyway. Turns out I had a positive HPV no abnormal cells 2023, my most recent smear found HPV and mild changes.
i was referred for a colposcopy where the consultant advised before the colposcopy I was likely CIN1 and they’d just have a look to verify but with women of my age (29) with no children they don’t usually do biopsy’s or treatment. While doing the colposcopy he said there was an area of concern that he’d biopsy. 
I’ve got a letter now to say the biopsy’s abnormal and I need treatment as the biopsy has contradicted the smear but they won’t tell me over the phone the results despite me asking as they ‘can’t give results like that over the phone’. 
apologies that’s long winded but I’m panicking now, my next appointment isn’t until the middle of October - has this been the case for anyone else? 
thanks so much sorry for the essay x

cervical,Question,CarrieG,Cervical cancer follow up,"
Hi,
I was diagnosed with stage 3c1 cervical cancer in June 2023. I had chemo, radiotherapy and brachytherapy with NED confirmed following an MRI in January 2024. I was given another MRI which showed I was still NED in may 2024. 
It was then agreed that my follow up would be an MRI every 6 months with telephone appointments every 4 months. This was to continue for 3 years before I'd be discharged from services. 
However I've now been told by my oncologist that I won't have any more MRI scans and my follow up will now be 6 monthly telephone appointments. Apparently new research shows that MRI in cervical cancer follow up is unhelpful and that those that had a complete response to treatment at the 4 months stage don't require mri scans or internals to monitor for recurrance. Instead I should remain vigilant and report any changes which would then be investigated. 
I've been told that chances of recurrance are small in those that have had a complete response at their 4 month scan. 
I just feel a bit uneasy with this. I didn't have symptoms until a few months prior to my diagnosis and I worry I wouldn't have symptoms of a recurrance until it's too late. But I don't want to be a nuisance and have a drama needlessly. They have assured me that symptoms are much more likely if a recurrance was to occur. 
Can anyone shed any light on what their experiences are. This is apparently based on new research.

cervical,Question,Kim A,Not enough cells from smear test - high risk HPV,"
I've had 4 smear tests this year at the colposcopy department (and previous to that I was having annual smears because of HPV) and each time, my cells have been unsatisfactory. My case was discussed at an MDT meeting after the smear results in April and they advised a repeat smear in July, which I've just had the results of. At my July appointment, my consultant said it was a complete mystery as to why my cells were repeatedly unsatisfactory and he effectively said to me ""we can't tell you this isn't cancer"" because there aren't any cells to actually check. But there were some positives; I didn't have the right strain of HPV that turns into sinister pathology, and any growth would have been visible on my smears. My latest results (from that repeat smear in July) have now come back as high-risk HPV and cells still unsatisfactory, which has really worried me because it seems to have changed to high risk very quickly, and the cells have still not been able to be checked. Now my case goes back to the next MDT meeting, I have spoken to my consultant's secretary and his likely recommendation is going to be LLETZ or loop treatment but I'm extremely worried that something is being missed because they can't check my cells.

cervical,Question,Aggie24,Debilitating fatigue 9 months after treatment,"
Hello, I’m looking for some advice after finishing treatment 9 months ago. I was diagnosed with cervical cancer and underwent chemo radiation and brachytherapy. The treatment has been successful and there is no signs of cancer. I am well but I am really struggling with fatigue. Some days I’m unable to get up from my bed and the days I am up I can do small jobs but just feel exhausted. I’ve been advised that it could be a combination of treatment and going through the menopause. I started HRT in February, the hot flushes have subsided but it’s not really helped with the fatigue. I’m struggling to potter about the house, was advised to try walking but this is even a struggle. The fatigue is so debilitating and I feel as though I’m not been the best mum. I struggle to go out with kids, I haven’t the energy to socialise and I feel as though I’m just an existence rather than been happy at having a second chance at life. I hope someone can advise and possibly help. Awaiting input from psychology and waiting to see the menopause specialist too. Thank you for taking time to read over my lengthy post, really grateful.

cervical,Question,Meme85,Diagnosed today with Stage 1 Grade 3 squamous cell carcinoma,"
Hi all,
i had recently posted ahead of receiving my results and received supportive feedback.  Thank you for this.
This evening I had a call from the hospital. The MDT meeting had finished and I’ve been diagnosed with Stage 1 Grade 3 squamous cell carcinoma. I’m pretty numb, but was also expecting it.. does that make sense?  I’d had abnormal bleeding after intercourse which is why I’d asked my GP for an internal examination. 
My LLETZ biopsy has come back has CIN 3 with no clear edges.  The MRI showed an abnormality on my cervix. And the PET scan confirmed the cancer was confined to my cervix.
I have an oncology appointment booked for the 7th August. Presumably this will be to discuss next steps. I will be having a hysterectomy. It has been agreed that this is the best course of action.
I feel relieved that they think the cancer is contained, but grade 3, does worry me as I know it is more likely to spread.
Has anyone else had the same diagnosis, and please can you share your experience?  Xx

Just loosing all confidence in this professionals and worried I have to trust them !

cervical,Question,Meme85,MRI followed by PET scan - scared,"
Hi all, so around 4 weeks ago my punch biopsy result came back as CIN 3. Two weeks ago I had a LLETZ procedure and the consultant took away 10mm of my cervix. This is my second LLETZ. The first was in 2016.
I was admitted to hospital after the second LLETZ because they could not stop the bleeding. Fun times…
Anyway, last Friday I had a MRI, which I know my consultant had made a referral for. But then on Monday I get a call from the bookings team, requesting I go to the hospital on the following day for a PET scan. So I’m massively panicking thinking that they’ve seen something on my MRI. 
I’ve left 2 voice mails with my consultant’s secretary asking why I had to go for a PET scan, but no response since this Tuesday. I got so worked over everything today, I booked an appointment to see my own GP who has thankfully prescribed me with Lorazepam which should take the edge off things whilst I wait for a response from the hospital. 
He confirmed to me that if the consultant radiologist made the PET scan referral then it is very likely that there is something abnormal showing in the MRI scan, but that this could be numerous things such as inflammation, infection, scarring and of course cancer. 
I feel so scared right now, and I wanted to write down my feelings and experiences so that I could share them with people who have been through or are going through this extremely daunting process. Any comments would be gratefully received. Xxx

cervical,Question,PanamaPanamera,Pap wrong/visible wound/ stage 2/4 cervical cancer,"
Hello, bad sad thing happened to my loved girlfriend stage 2/4(still question) cervix cancer.
Short story, Shes 27 started doing paps 3 years ago all negatives First pap she did 25 all went fine then second last year but also went negative PAP was taken by nurse without gloves when she was taking it stick and her hand was in blood she said oops a bit blood also said theres visible wound (which nurse told is not curable) inside , then she asked do you feel any hurting during inmacy she said no then nurse said hm strange, do check pap after 1 year. Then family doctor knew about wound but didin't do anything like more examinations or anything said everything fine but said you are in risk group(didin't even explain what or why then didin't send to do HPI test??)
Few weeks ago she did third pap which showed positive then they took biopsy which showed also positive (without mri or anything family doctor suggested it's stage 3 she asked why she said its guess)
We went to other private doctor which said tumor is visible by eye also that wound(by now was coin size) needs examination, they did examination and said it became cancerous, we did mri results came bad doctor first said second stage cancer visible perfectly in cervix but she asked then did you move during mri?Girlfriend says no and thinks no but who can lay 1hour without movement in old mri And she asked this because results are not clear and look like stage 4 metastised to other parts(not brain or lungs)
We are going to private new mri technology (bio) device which takes 15-20mins after 3 days
About symptoms:She have pelvix pain/back pain 6-7/10 And today started bleeding. Emottionaly it's very hard cause probabbly it's stage 4... No other symptoms Cbd/cbg doesen't help to relieve pain.
We also found some dendritic cell therapy which have 0 information about success also costs tons of money.. and question would it even help..
Any thoughts how bad it could be? Private doctor says cancer isin't noticed by time and cured probabbly stage 4..But pap showed all negatives, but thing is family doctor didin't even care about wound...Said everything fine if she would say need examination we would've done everything to examine..Either she even didin't say about cancer visible by eye..Private only said..

cervical,Question,Roxy_123,Fast Track Referral,"
Went to GP with ongoing issues relating to menopause. Constant thrush, sore, itching and incontinence ongoing. Had smear three and half years ago am 59. All normal no HPV said low risk cervical cancer. Next one was due five years time. Had a speculum exam in February this year nothing noted on exam by GP. Have mirena coil for HRT purposes and on Oestrogel. So on recent GP appointment had speculum exam and she noted a small red lesion on cervix that looked like erosion/graze. Referred fast track. Seen yesterday and I was expecting a coloscopy to look closely at my cervix. Doctor just did speculum exam and noted the red area said it looked like erosion but was irregular in appearance, not a full ring of red. It was bleeding on contact. He took biopsy and as it was bleeding applied silver nitrate. He said he would arrange a scan just to check my womb etc for my piece of mind. He said he wasn’t worried. I have to wait four weeks for results. I’m not clear why a colonoscopy wasn’t done as I may have got more reassurance if he’d looked close up? I had very mild changes many years ago at 25, but cleared with laser and thankfully no problems since. Also if it was anything other than an erosion would it take a while to develop into anything as my last smear was clear 3.5 years ago. The doctor also noted on speculum exam I have thrush again. I have it constant and believe my hrt could be contributing. Gave me prescription for long term thrush treatment and vagifem to help with my other symptoms. I asked if okay to use prior to results and he said yes I’m not worried. I’m also waiting for a referral for my bladder too as I have white cells in my urine, but gp thinks contamination from thrush infections. Just feel so upset and worried. Also why didn’t he do coloscopy? I felt rushed at appointment. Four weeks a long time to wait when worrying.

i was diagnosed with stage 3C2 cervical cancer with lymph node involvement (pelvic and Para-aortic lymph nodes) back in Dec 22
i had chemorads and brachytherapy over a 7 week period as they couldn’t do the hysterectomy as i was at the latter stages
i have had clear MRI’s and physical checks every three months and have been told i am now in remission NED, but a few weeks ago my left clavical lymph node became enlarged and i had lots of swelling around that area too. i was given CT scan that came back clear, so then had a needle biopsy - i am still awaiting the results and they have now ordered a PET scan.
Has anyone else been in this situation? I wasn’t panicking until they ordered the PET scan
any information would be useful

Hi, newly diagnosed 2b last week after everyone thinking it was stage1. The hospital has been super quick getting me in for chemo and I start next week. I'm a little surprised that they've arranged for my radio planning scan before I even start chemo? It's this normal? I'm not complaining but it's not what they told me would happen. I guess all this feels like it's happened super fast anyway! Perhaps they're catching me up to where I should be if I'd been diagnosed stage 2 in the first place or is this normal? 
Any advice appreciated in this whirlwind! ‍‍

Hi, newly diagnosed 2b last week after everyone thinking it was stage1. The hospital has been super quick getting me in for chemo and I start next week. I'm a little surprised that they've arranged for my radio planning scan before I even start chemo? It's this normal? I'm not complaining but it's not what they told me would happen. I guess all this feels like it's happened super fast anyway! Perhaps they're catching me up to where I should be if I'd been diagnosed stage 2 in the first place or is this normal? 
Any advice appreciated in this whirlwind! ‍‍

Hi
ive posted before, you might have seen me. I have tomophobia which is fear of medical procedures. 
I have been told I will need 4 sessions of brachytherapy over a week (Monday to Friday). They will get me in on Monday, do a spinal, then general, position the rods, wheel me to a scan to check and then wheel me to do the treatment and wheel me back to the ward until the next day. This will repeat every day for 4 days. They will let me out on the Friday or the Saturday. I asked my oncologist and my nurse and they have both said there is zero chance of this plan changing. It will be that and nothing else. I was hoping after my research and speaking to other women that I wouldn’t need it or would only need one day if it had gone. They have said this will absolutely not happen. 
When I say I am terrified, I mean it sends me in to a panic attack terrified. I have never been an inpatient at hospital. I am completely and utterly petrified of it. I am terrified of being stuck paralysed in a hospital bed for an entire week. I won’t see my two small children for a week. That’s not even starting on my fears about side effects. How on earth am I going to do this, and come out without being completely traumatised?

cervical,Question,La2uk2012,CIN2/3 waiting for Biopsy,"
Hello Everyone, as many of you im Anxiously waiting biopsy results ( they took 5) smear test showed high grade changes, to previous 2 years before which was low grade. I’m very anxious because when I had the smear test the nurse said she could see I need colposcopy but try not to worry, then 4 days later I was called for one, I was told I would be treated that day. When I got there I was not treated and took biopsies instead. Said mild to moderate ACW. Part of me thinks I’m sure it’s all fine, then I’m panicking I’m just walking around with cancer. 
has anyone else ever had CIN2/3 and it come back as cancer? Or would they have seen it’s cancer in Colposcopy and told me then?

Fast track to last Tuesday... I went for a smear and the nurse mentioned my cervix looked a little abnormal and asked my to book in with my GP. She took a look and said its defiantly not a polyp and the lesion was cobblestone in appearance. 
She's referred me to Colposcopy, but the referral says Urgent referral for suspected gynaecological cancer! And it also says suspicious lesion. 
Has anyone else had this, and what was the outcome. I'm still awaiting the results of my smear test so I'm not sure if the HPV is back or anything. How long did most peoples smears take to come back?

Hello all,
Any advice would be greatly appreciated. My sister recently went for a smear test and was told that she had abnormal cells.  She had a colposcopy around 4 weeks ago and was told that all being well, she only need to come back in 6 months for another smear test. Last  week she received a letter from the hospital with an appointment with a consultant gynaecologist for Monday.
My sister feels like it’s got to be bad news as she was specifically told that they wouldn’t need to see her for another 6 months. She has been having hip pain for the last two years, had very irregular periods and had been diagnosed with peri menopause along with some other symptoms.

Can I ask what your first symptoms were? Do you think that is the reason for the appointment?
we lost our mum to cancer when she was young so we are both quite worried.

In 2021 I was diagnosed with servical cancer with lymph node spread, stage 3. Treated with chemo, radio and brachytherapy. All cleared.
This Easter noticed my full length right leg is swallen, and my pelvis lymph nodes on the right side enlarged. The leg itself doesn't hurt, but there is discomfort when walking or doing any physical activity. CT scan showed some abnormalities, now waiting for MRI.
If the cancer came back do I still have any chance for a happy life or this is it? What are the treatment options? What are the chances?

cervical,Question,Aquabambi,Superior Vena Cava stent,"
Back in Feb I developed a massive blood clot at the end of my port, it almost entirely blocked my superior vena cava and extended down into the right atrium of my heart and led to a delightful 6 week hospital admission.
Since discharge I’ve managed to complete my radiotherapy treatment and now they are looking at dealing with the clot & port. 
The blood clot has shrunk significantly in the past 3 months (I’m on blood thinner injections) and I had a call today from my oncologist. 
They want to remove my port and place a stent in my SVC to prevent further issues.
I’ll meet with the interventional radiologists in a couple of weeks to discuss it further in detail, but does anyone have any personal experiences of SVC stent they would be happy to share with me, so I can know what to expect?

cervical,Question,Masey,3cm Mass Lesion hanging from Cervix,"
Hi, I had bleeding start over the weekend & then went to the doctors who noticed a 3cm mass lesion hanging from the cervix. I’ve been referred urgently to get this tested. I’m just scared , as single mum of 2 kids. What’s the chances of this being cancer (which I have been preparing myself for) but what stage is this likely to be or what grade? Anyone had this ? Or know much or able to offer any information ? X

Hi

i I have 3c1 cervical cancer. 27mm tumour on cervix and 1 lymph node involved. Apparently the lymph node is around 1cm so the consultant said it’s ‘borderline’. I’ve not been able to find any success stories for 3c1 really. It’s all 1b1/2b. Is there anyone on here who had 3c1 and it’s not come back or gone elsewhere?

I was given the results of my colposcopy on 22nd Feb then had my appointments for an MRI, CT then saw my consultant on the 11th March and was told I had 2A and needed a PET CT which I had yesterday. I’m seeing my oncologist on 2/4 which is when I’ll be told when my treatment will start, they are predicting towards the end of April.

I was diagnosed with stage 1a1 adenocarcinoma of cervix in Dec. I have had an LLETZ and cone biopsy.
the latest cone biopsy showed clear margins. 
i had a follow up appointment today and was told i could either opt for a hysterectomy (recommended) or continue with 6 monthly check ups. 
i am 36, single with no children. I am trying to decide which option to go for next. I think the anxiety of waiting every 6 months will be too much for me?

Hi,
I’ve just completed my 5 week chemoradiation and brachytherapy treatment.
It has not been straightforward as have also had issues with high blood pressure and a recent infection which resulted in additional stays in hospital.
I’m now back home, but would be interested to hear how long it has taken others to feel just slightly ‘normal’? I have no energy and just walking up a flight of stairs is exhausting (and I was fit before treatment). I’m also suffering from tummy issues (to put it politely!).

cervical,Question,Sugarplum,HPV questions,"
Hi everyone
i am 4 weeks post op for radical hysterectomy. I had hpv which caused my cancer. I have so many questions about it all but my surgeon isn’t gonna be the guy to ask and going private for my op in the end means I don’t have an oncology nurse to call. I’m so worried that me and my husband will never get back to how we were. I feel like he just sees me as someone he has to look after now and we won’t ever get back our intimate side of our marriage. I mentioned something earlier just joking about and he just said “you know there’s no test for hpv for men”. I know I’m only 4 weeks post op but it’s worrying me that his worries will mean the end of that part of us. we have been together over 20 years and there’s no question of cheating here at all just to clear that up. That’s not what I’m worried about. I’ve been told I can’t get pregnant anymore so we no longer need to use contraception but how will I then not just get the hpv virus again if I passed it to him or he passed it to me to begin with? I had no signs of hpv, I was shocked to see I had it and he has no signs either but obviously still could have it. This whole thing has made me feel awful and just gross, and I’m worried that’s how he sees me now too.  Don’t help that I’m tired and emotional either.
I have read loads on different sites but just can’t find the answers.
I’m also waiting to hear if need to start a course of chemo as my histology was borderline for me needing it. So stress levels are up again. I hope you’re all ok as can be

cervical,Question,Frenchiefrankenstein,Cervical cancer.Hospital phobia.,"
Hello. 
I was referred in January on a 2 week wait to gynaecology for bleeding after sex and a vascular appearance. She did a smear in this appointment because I had never had one before (don’t start, I know, I have medical/hospital phobia and I’ve never been able to go. I’ve even had my two children at home). This smear came back with high grade dyskarosis hpv positive. they said I needed to have the LLETZ. I had to have this under general anaesthetic. When I say hospital phobia, I mean I physically shake, cry, hyperventilate and am generally a complete state (and nuisance, I am sure). They were great and got me in first in the list, put me in a side room. that was two weeks ago. I received a letter today to say that I am to come to the hospital on Monday because the biopsy showed changes that need ‘further attention’. With it being Friday, and me a complete mental case, I called them sobbing to ask if someone could please call me and tell me what is happening so I’m not spending all weekend waiting. 
they called back and said that it’s cancer. I need to have an MRI and CT scan. more hospital visits. I’m terrified of the hospital. Terrified of the scans. Terrified of the results. Terrified of any treatment I may need. 
I don’t know what I’m asking for here really. I just feel like I’d rather not be here to deal with all of this, I don’t know how I’m going to cope. I don’t know if I can mentally and physically stand any sort of long term treatment for it. 
I’m only 35. I have two young children. I don’t want them to watch me go through this. And possibly wither and die.

they called back and said that it’s cancer. I need to have an MRI and CT scan. more hospital visits. I’m terrified of the hospital. Terrified of the scans. Terrified of the results. Terrified of any treatment I may need. 
I don’t know what I’m asking for here really. I just feel like I’d rather not be here to deal with all of this, I don’t know how I’m going to cope. I don’t know if I can mentally and physically stand any sort of long term treatment for it. 
I’m only 35. I have two young children. I don’t want them to watch me go through this. And possibly wither and die.

Hello,
I am after advice from those that have had full hysterectomy at an earlier age and was sent into early menopause. I have been to see a different dr today and she has told me that I should be having a full hysterectomy for the type of cancer I have and not keeping my ovaries like my original consultant has told me I can. I wanted to keep them as I’m only 39 and not ready to deal with early menopause. But this dr today said she removes them every time with this cancer as it’s likely to go to ovaries. Can anyone tell me what it’s like taking HRT please? I know everyone is different but how did you find early menopause with recovering from surgery at same time? Are there any side effects from the HRT? And how many tablets do you take and for how long?any other advice I’d be very grateful for.

I've just finished initial 6 weeks of chemo (carboplatin/paclitaxol) and starting chemo/radiotherapy next week. So far, side effects have been minimal but yesterday the skin on my face suddenly became sensitive to everything (itchy red patches) and I'm breaking out in spots.... as if life wasn't hard enough!

Would any lovely ladies who have completed Brachytherapy please share their experiences with me - good and bad?

Immediately following this I have 4 sessions of Brachytherapy as an inpatient in 2 goes over 2 weeks and I'm feeling really low and scared about treatment and what my reality will look like afterwards in terms of likely long term side effects.

I have to go for a Lletz under gen an in two weeks and I'm starting to really worry. I've not even been told what was found and my GP only knows the same info, basically what the hospital letter says

In the meantime had a colposcopy and finally the hysteroscopy in Oct. In Dec got the letter which just said results unsatisfactory and had to have a Lletz under general. No indication of cancer/pre-cancerous and when I rang the hospital the nurse just told me what would happen. 

So does this mean I have cancer? I must have something if they are doing it. And has anyone had this and under general? I've never had any kind of medical thing. Late 40s (I had an early menopause) and really fit and healthy so surely I would have other symptoms? Sorry for the freak out x

cervical,Question,Ysor,Scared,"
Hello.
i am reaching out here as I am worrying so could do with some advice.
i have been having irregular bleeding and will bleed for around 30 days at a time. I bleed after intercourse and sometimes it is painful too. This has been going on for a couple of years . I’m also having trouble with my bladder and am frequently urinating much more than usual and find it hard to hold my urine.
i went private and apparently I have a white lesion on my cervix which the dr wants to biopsy and do a colposcopy ans see if there are any other bits to biopsy .

has anyone had these symptoms and had cervical cancer? Also if you have had cervical cancer what did they say it looked like?

thank you

cervical,Question,Wilco,Stage 3c1,"
Hi everyone, 
my sister has just been diagnosed with stage 3c1 cervical cancer, she has a 4.5cm tumour and it is also in her pelvic lymph nodes, she also lives in Spain and I am finding this so difficult, so I am here for info and advice, I just want to make sure she not missing anything or if she needs to ask certain questions, I am worried about the language barrier!
so she has had mri and Pet scan, they have staged it, surgery isn’t an option as it’s to big (I think that’s what they said) she has been to her doctor today who has informed her that she needs another PET scan, she was not aware of this. Is this normal? Any info would be really appreciated right now!

Hi I was wondering what treatment timescales everyone has faced/ is dealing with following diagnosis? 10 weeks after I spoke with the consultant and diagnosis was confirmed I’m still waiting for an operation date. I was given an 8-12 weeks timeframe but haven’t heard anything since my pre-op assessments. Specialist nurse doesn’t reply to emails or phone messages. I know things can be fluid but had hoped I would have heard whether it will actually be before 2024! Is there anyway I can find out? What are others experiences. I’m in wales if that makes any difference, waiting for a radical hysterectomy.

cervical,Question,Fi29,Confusing Results CIN / Biopsy / Please Help,"

Hi guys, just a brief background, i went for my first smear test back in August and received results that i have mild changes so was booked in for colposcopy. when my doctor looked with the colposcopy he said that he could see mild changes but took a biopsy to confirm as apparently it was in a few different places. after this my mind was clear and i felt very reassured as my doctor basically confirmed that it was only mild changes.
i then went in for consultation of biopsy results where he told me that biopsy actually showed cin3. Also, I was pregnant at this point but had a termination after I received my results. I asked to be referred for a 2nd opinion and was given ‘one of the best’. So again, I went to see doctor no2 and she told me that because I was pregnant she’d like to perform smear + colposcopy + biopsy again as she said the pregnancy may have affected the results. She did biopsy and only took 2 whereas my previous doctor took around 6/7.
I got my results back today and the smear showed HPV high risk but no signs of cell changes and my biopsy showed cin1 and cin2.
So now I’m just confused as how can the 2nd smear and biopsy results differ so much from one another where they were taken less than 1 min apart. When I asked her she just said I don’t know, sometimes this happens. Not very helpful.
My first doctor had said that there is no evidence to suggest that being pregnant will affect results but my 2nd one disagrees.
My 2nd doctor has suggested I wait another 6 months and see what happens but i’m worried as I don’t know which result is accurate and which one to follow. Also, waiting another 6 months with this on my mind is going to be exhausting. I think whether it is cin 2 or 3 I’d want to have it treated as I’ve done a lot of research on potential side effects and the main one would be premature baby but that has a tiny risk so I’m not too worried about it.
Honestly, I’m just very confused as I don’t know how to proceed and even if I was to proceed which doctor I would do it with.

Hi everyone.
I’m Lizzie, 26 and feeling very overwhelmed. 
My mum is beginning treatment this week for an advanced bladder cancer, and following a long while of increasingly painful pelvic cramps/ needing to wee constantly I’m now on my own journey. 
I went to my GP - who was unsure about the appearance of my cervix, it looked inflamed and red. I saw a nurse specialist this week who performed both a smear and a punch biopsy. I’ve never had a smear so as you can imagine I am fearing for the worst right now.
The nurse couldn’t see anything too alarming, however she could see a red patch which she suspects is HPV, is it common to have HPV causing red patches without it being harmful or developing into cancer?
My main concern is how much pain I’m in on a daily basis, the nurse doesn’t seem to think my cervix is causing this pain and that it may be coming from my uterus or another organic around the pelvis. I’m on a waiting game for more scans of my abdomen but I’m feeling myself spiralling into panic watching my mum go through her own battle. I’m really scared, confused and unsure as to why I’m in so much pain but I feel they’re missing something and that the cervical issue might be incidental findings. 
if anybody has any experience or advice on this; I’d be so grateful.

cervical,Question,Resident46,Emergency GP referral,"
Hi,
I've just been referred to the gynaecology consultant as an emergency appointment after visiting my doctor with prolonged and heavy discharge, lower tummy and back pain and the odd spotting.
When she examined me she found my cervix was very inflamed and 'angry' with dark patches on it. She said she could see even the fluid leaking whilst examining me.
A few months ago I started getting sharp and aching pains in my legs which on a previous visit to the GP and xray was put down to degenerative changes in my spine.  I'm not convinced it was after reading that leg pain can be a symptom of cervical cancer. 
Has anyone else experienced these symptoms? 
My appointment should arrive in the next week but I'm on pins.

A few months ago I started getting sharp and aching pains in my legs which on a previous visit to the GP and xray was put down to degenerative changes in my spine.  I'm not convinced it was after reading that leg pain can be a symptom of cervical cancer. 
Has anyone else experienced these symptoms? 
My appointment should arrive in the next week but I'm on pins.
Thanks 
Julie

cervical,Question,Anna92,Chemo and radiotherapy,"
Hi all 
I've been diagnosed with cervical cancer in July. They thought it was just in my cervix and assured me that they can just remove that part and pretty much the only side effect would be having to have c section in the future. They then said that actually I will need radical hysterectomy but then can leave my ovaries in. I went through fertility treatment and managed to freeze 2 embryos in case we manage to find a surrogate in the future. During the procedure they found a microscopic changes in one of my lymph nodes which meant they couldn't carry on with the surgery. I'm left with a big scar, had to take strong painkillers for over a week and have ro inject myself for a month to prevent bloodclots (not exactly an issue but also not something that's making me feel better).
Now the only option is chemo and radiotherapy. It's unlikely i will lose my hair but my uterus and ovaries will stop working meaning I will go into early Menopause and will never procedure eggs or be able to carry a baby (plus all the possible side effects from both chemo and radiotherap). (I'm 31, with my partner for 8 years and was trying to get pregnant for the last 2 years).
I know deep down I have to go through this but I'm struggling to accept it (I accepted the hysterectomy but wasn't prepared for Menopause and not being able to produce more eggs if needs be in the future). I've looked into adoption but they would like me to wait 3 years from the end of the treatment before I can apply, which does make sense but again its hard to accept in my head
Does anyone have similar experience/positive stories or things that helped them?

cervical,Question,May2,Bladder issues after radical hysterectomy,"
Hi, I’m just over two weeks post radical hysterectomy. I’ve had 2 trials without catheter now. I did better at the last one. I could squeeze some urine out but not enough. I don’t have any feeling of needing a wee. I’m being referred to urology now. 
I just wondered if anybody else lost their feeling of needing a wee and whether it came back? Or if anyone struggled to wee but it got better? I’d also appreciate hearing of anyones experience of urology and what they can do to help. 
I know my surgeon went through the risks before surgery but honestly I had to blank out some of it! He is going to call me this week which will hopefully help but at the moment I’m not sure if this will be a long term issue or something that can improve!

cervical,Question,Fi29,HPV and CIN3 - please help / guidance / support,"
Hi so just to give a bit of background - I’m 24 years old and went for my first smear test a couple of months ago. I got my result and was told I was HPV positive and mild changes to cervix. I went in for the colposcopy and the doctor told me he can see mild changes but he would take a biopsy because it looks likes it’s in a few places - just to confirm. around this time I also found out I was pregnant and my decision was difficult already as I have a few health issues so I was very undecided. anyway, when I went in for my follow up consultation I was expecting the doctor to just confirm what he has seen. But he said they found severe changes to cervix - CIN3. He told me if I was to continue my pregnancy I would have to wait 3 months after giving birth to be treated or if I was to terminate id have to wait at least 6 weeks. I was veryyy shocked with this and felt it was too much to take in. so I made the decision to terminate the pregnancy as it seemed too risky to me to continue with the pregnancy when there is over 45% chance of it progressing. Anyway so now I have to wait 6 weeks min to be treated. I’m super worried that this is something that I’m going to suffer with my whole life. I was wondering if any of you have any experience in this and any guidance or help. And also, once the cells are treated if there is anything I can do to boost my immunity and hopefully the HPV will leave my body. thank you :)

I am relatively new to all this and also new to the forum.
I've been recommended to have a hysterectomy due to Stage 1 cancer (microscopic) and, as I'm over 50, the surgeon has given me the choice as to whether I have my ovaries removed or not too.  No history of ovarian or breast cancer in the family.  Anyone else been given a choice and what helped you to decide?
Many thanks in advance.

cervical,Question,Squirrel87,Bleeding,"
Hi, I don't even know where to turn on this one but I bathed my mum this afternoon as she's feeling so weak currently. After she got out she had a sit down and I noticed there were 4/5 spots of blood on the towel she stood on when she was out. She said oh I'm sure it's normal but Its only just started. Is that normal for stage 4 cervical cancer. I don't know when she is telling the truth about things or not, the oncologist asked her is she had any bleeding earlier this week and she said no. Obviously it's the weekend so not sure where to turn plus she didn't seem bothered so I don't know whether I will just be seen as interfering?
Thought I would ask here with others that have or are going through the same that they may know

cervical,Question,Bobbylou,Urgent MRI- things happening fast,"
Hi there! So I’ve had a bit of a weird day, to say the least. I’ve been having menstrual issues for a couple of years and had a few tests. Last year I was given a Mirena for excessive pain and irregular periods, and a few months ago I was prescribed Norethisterone as the Mirena wasn’t working. Biopsies were taken and then referred to another hospital. Fast forward to this morning and me and my family’s last day of a wonderful weekend at a caravan park, and I get a call from my consultant saying a lesion had been found on my cervix and I had to make my way to hospital for a blood test in order to attend an urgent MRI. 
So, a great day 
In all seriousness my head is in a spin. I took the phone call as we were literally cleaning up the caravan before checkout. I feel like I can’t trust anything I remember from what she said on the phone because my head was everywhere, but I made it to hospital and got my blood test. And she mentioned that “small cells” were found but she has a very strong accent and I’m not sure if I misheard. God, my head is a mess and I don’t even know what I’m looking for.

cervical,Question,Eire,Waiting on treatment to start. Restaged this week.,"
Hello Sisters, hope you're keeping well.
This week, my PET-CT confirmed that a couple of lymphnodes have decided to join the party. Not the news I wanted to hear but I'm now one step closer to starting treatment. Met with the chemo and radiotherapy teams yesterday to discuss the treatment -- received SO much information that my brain still feels frazzled. 
While I'm trying to keep the worrying about which stage I'm in to a minimum, I won't lie. It bleeping sucks. I would write other things but I have a feeling I'd be flagged for my choice of words. I feels like someone has given me a big rucksack filled wiith stones to carry on this mountain hike I'm on. I'm still on the path, but it's just a wee bit heavier and more challenging...
Now I'm waiting to hear on when I'll have my planning CT and when treatment can start. 
For those who have been through chemoradiation. What did you put in your chemobag? And which cream did you use post radiation?

I feel this is a little too much information but was wondering if anyone else had experienced this, I have a review tomorrow and will mention to radiologist
Im almost finished week 4 of radio/chemo. I have one more week than internal.
I started my period Monday , it was due , but it hasn’t behaved like a normal period, it normally lasts 3/4 days but day 5 and I keep passing large clots, I think they are from my vagina but having googled now worried it’s bladder and I know it sounds ridiculous but I don’t know how to work out which!
They fall out when I go to the loo before I start weeing
Any thoughts? Is it normal to bleed like this? I thought they said I wouldn’t get another period and go into menopause instead

I know my post op lymph node analysis came back clear and they took good margins at the time.    (I was early detected at stage 2). 
im not sure what I expected really.  What have others experienced at  check ups -  post op ??

I've just received my Colposcopy results, and they showed, early Invasive squamous cell cervical cancer. I have an appointment with the consultant, next week. But he called me, yesterday, to reassure me, that Its nothing to worry about. He did however mention, that the options, for treatment, would be either, Hysterectomy or another LEETZ procedure.I have done a lot of research and to be honest, as my diagnosis was High grade HPV. Either option, won't completely remove the virus. Im really struggling to  decide what to do for the best.
Any advice appreciated

cervical,Question,Bubbsy80,Radiotherapy - Scared of side effects,"
Hi all,
Ive had a radical hysterectomy in jan due to cervical cancer -  due to complications during the op i have had to live with ureter stents and a catheter in place for 8 wks. I suffered with numerous uti’s and stent irritation on my bladder which was horrendous.

Hi all,
Ive had a radical hysterectomy in jan due to cervical cancer -  due to complications during the op i have had to live with ureter stents and a catheter in place for 8 wks. I suffered with numerous uti’s and stent irritation on my bladder which was horrendous.

cervical,Question,fiona1,Waiting on results ..,"
Soo .. where do i start. I was ten years overdue my smear test. I received a letter afterwards to say that they had found abnormalities and hpv was found. I then had to go for a biopsy. I then received another letter to say i had to attend another appointment. The consultant told me i had to get a LEEP procedure done because there was high grade precancerous cells that had to be treated. Afterwards i thought i didn’t need to be seen again until six months when i would need to have another smear done. A few months passed and i received another letter to say these high grade precancerous cells were present in the deeper margin and these are CIN3. I attended another hospital appointment and again had another LEEP procedure. My consultant told me that basically if this LEEP procedure doesn’t work then my next option is a hysterectomy. Iam now awaiting results from my second LEEP. My head is racing every day no matter how much i try to put it to the back of my head. Has anyone else had this experience? What’s the odds of me going back to be told that infact cancer is actually present? I have tried contacting my GP for advice but unfortunately they have no availability to see or speak to me. Iam 31 years of age with two girls who are 11 and 9. I work full time as a senior care assistant in a care home. What’s the recovery time from a hysterectomy?

cervical,Question,fallingleaves88,"Hysteroscopy, cervical polyp removal - how long is the recovery time?","
Hi, I'm new to the online forum. I'm so stressed out and need some advice. I went to the GP because of a large polyp looking mass in my vagina, she put me on the 2 week pathway. I saw the gynecologist last week and she saw a ""suspicious looking cervix"" and a large polyp. I meant to have the polyp removed and a hysterscopy in 2 weeks under general anaesthetic  but the my preop assessment nurse told me I'm anemic, so I can't have the surgery yet until that's resolved. All this waiting is making me anxious! Do you normally get the hysterscopy results straight away or you have to wait until the polyp biopsy comes back? 
I've been googling about the recovery time for cervical polyp removal and hysterscopy, apparently the downtime is a day or two. Is this true? Has anyone had this procedure done, is it painful? My dad has terminal cancer, I go to my parents house every evening to give my mum a break. I don't want to worry them so I'm keeping quiet about this, that's why I'm so keen to know what the recover time is. Can anyone share their experiences? 
Fingers cross there's nothing wrong with me and it's just a polyp, it will be extremely  challenging if I was ill and I have to look after my dad as well.

Hello, 

Am new here and terrified. About 4 months before I noticed a streak of blood with cervical mucus. I kept spotting and seeing mucus with blood till now. Furthermore, my period is heavier and I got it more frequently. At first the gynecologist said that it is because of the IUD , I asked another opinion he said maybe it is some infections and ordered a Pap smear which was normal. I thought maybe it is from the IUD till last week i decided to remove the IUD because I always have that anxiety that I have cancer. I was shocked that I still have spotting.
I went to the doctor and he said that he will investigate further and I was waiting for the approval. I thought he ordered colposcopy as i know that this is the diagnostic procedure.I have been reading a lot … 
now the insurance company called me to inform that I got the approval for hysteroscopy!!!! Actually l, I can’t trust that gynecologist I feel that he has Alzheimer’s. have been waiting a lot and I feel like l lost a year minimum . Do you advise seeing another doctor to order colposcopy instead! And wait even more ?! Am really lost and angry

cervical,Question,Regj,Cytology and biopsy results disagree,"
Hello everyone, I am hoping to get any information/knowledge/advice from people who have more experience than me.
I had an abnormal smear a couple of months ago, testing positive for HPV and showing cancer. When I went for my colposcopy, the doctor assumed I had missed previous smears but I explained I have always attended every 3 years and never been called back. 
5 weeks later I have just had a call from her explaining that there is a discrepancy between the cytology and biopsy results. Cytology have reconfirmed several times there is definitely cancer, but the biopsy is completely normal. She said this is very unusual and they will contact me in a week to arrange more tests.
Has anyone ever heard of this happening before? Any opinions about which test is more likely to be correct? I completely understand the medical professionals dont want to give any indications before they are certain, but I am so new to this that I would like to at least prepare myself for the possible outcomes I'm dealing with here.
Absolutely any information or thoughts would be helpful, I know so little! Thank you for reading.

cervical,Question,Regj,Cytology and biopsy results disagree,"
Hello everyone, I am hoping to get any information/knowledge/advice from people who have more experience than me.
I had an abnormal smear a couple of months ago, testing positive for HPV and showing cancer. When I went for my colposcopy, the doctor assumed I had missed previous smears but I explained I have always attended every 3 years and never been called back. 
5 weeks later I have just had a call from her explaining that there is a discrepancy between the cytology and biopsy results. Cytology have reconfirmed several times there is definitely cancer, but the biopsy is completely normal. She said this is very unusual and they will contact me in a week to arrange more tests.
Has anyone ever heard of this happening before? Any opinions about which test is more likely to be correct? I completely understand the medical professionals dont want to give any indications before they are certain, but I am so new to this that I would like to at least prepare myself for the possible outcomes I'm dealing with here.
Absolutely any information or thoughts would be helpful, I know so little! Thank you for reading.

cervical,Question,Moneypenny79,What to do... is this neglegence?,"
Hi all, not quite sure where to start with this......
I was diagnosed with Cervical Cancer on 21.01.21.I had a radical hysterectomy on 01.03.21, safe to say it’s been a roller coaster, bt I don’t need to tell all of you that 
The cancer was picked up on my routine cervical screening in November 2020, I had been clear of anything on any screening before that, never had any symptomshowever…… my consultant asked to see me yesterday as he had received results back from an audit they had carried out on all of my screening up until November 2020, part of the cancer diagnosis process.I was told that the results of the audit had showed that pre-cancerous cells were found on my screening in 2017 however this was reported as clear.
I was told that if this was picked up in 2017 (as it should have) then my treatment would have been very different, I basically wouldn’t have had to go through the last two years of hurt and worry and pain, it’s such difficult information to process.
Anyone else been in a similar situation?

cervical,Question,Musicmum,Treatment options and rights,"
Hi everyone,

I was diagnosed with cancer on 13th Feb and since then my emotional have been up and down, lots of appointments and scans etc. 
At my last appointment I got my CT and MRI results back. They were good in terms of speed of growth and not spreading to other areas. Cancer is in my cervix and glands. I was given three treatment options:
Option 1: another Letz, wait roughly 3 weeks for my results and then only surgery to have my lymph nodes removed if the letz was successful this time round. Risk is they leave some behind and I'll need surgery to remove the rest anyway and the waiting has been really bad for my mental health.
Option 2: radical tracahelectomy and lymph node removal. 
Options 3: radical hysterectomy and lymph node removal.

I opted for option 2 and signed consent form. I felt this gave me the best changes to ensure it was all gone and still keep my facility as I'm only 32. Consultant and Maccillian nurse seemed to think i made the best call.
Consultant rings friday and says he's been back to MDT and they want me to have another Letz. This would mean if successful any future pregnancy would not have to be c section but the anxious wait is back, the delay in my surgery and the possibility of leaving some behind remains. I have also come on my period today so I don't think they will do the letz this week anyway so a further wait again. 

Do I have the right to refuse to have the letz and go with the treatment option I gave consent for in the first place or not??

cervical,Question,NicNak,Changed staging after PET scan,"
Hi
i have previously posted about my journey so far and the last update i gave i had been waiting for a PET scan. MRI suggested no lymph node involvement 

I had an appointment with my consultant yesterday who then told me that PET has revealed it is in the para-ayotic lymph node and have now staged me at 3c

I just froze and my brain switched off, whilst he was talking all i heard was white noise. Not sure what all of this means and could do with a little info from someone who has been in this situation.

They have said that i need to be referred to another hospital for treatment and this could take 2-3 weeks for an initial  appointment so still have no details of treatment plan apart from it will be chemoradiation. Is my situation now more urgent? What does it mean if it has spread to the lymph nodes 

I have so much going through my mind at the moment as well as dealing with hospital/needle/vein phobias from past trauma. 
any support, advise or suggestions are welcomed as i feel backed into a corner and quite alone at the moment.

I’m anaemic, but other than that am in okay health. Did/does anyone else continue to feel queasy for no apparent reason? 
thank you
Agatha

cervical,Question,Faireenuff,Treatment starts next week,"
Hi Sarah H, Hi Ladies,
I posted before after diagnosis but before stage/scans.
Had mri 6 weeks after LLETZ (wasn’t bothered by claustrophobia but the noises it made nearly had me jumping off the table and running out the door…) was informed have stage 2B squamous, PET-CT didn’t show anything else, had the consultant appt, the planning scan and got my 4 new freckles 
Treatment is 25Radio/5Chemo (carboplatin)/3Brachy and starts next week , am all kinds of anxious at moment and know this is another stage on my way to recovery.
I think I’m scared of the unknown and panicking over side effects I might not even get.
Am putting together a little bag of stuff to take to hospital appt’s and just wondering if any ladies can recommend stuff I might need or that helped them, I appreciate everyone’s journey is unique to them but I feel more on top of things if I can plan and organise for likely scenarios.  I’ve got tissues/wipes/water/mints/kindle/knitting/lip balm so far.
Any thoughts/advice/suggestions would be welcome.
Thanks and best wishes X

cervical,Question,Steve40,Update From Oncology Mixed Emotions,"
Hi, Im Steve,
My wife was diagnosed before Christmas with what the gyno described as possibly stage 1b adrenocarcinoma. We had a hellish wait over the festive period undergoing an MRI too, to see what we are battling.
Today we received a call from an oncology nurse to tell us that from the scans they could see it hadn't spread and that it was a large stand alone tumour on the cervix. They also said they had a consultant in the next city who wished to take the case on and wished to resolve this with surgery only and no chemo / radio. The surgical procedure would be a radical hysteroctomy and they dont intend to give us the option of harvesting eggs as this can cause delays and they want to do the durgery asap.
I am so happy and relieved we caught this early and there is a clear quick solution. However we are crushed that we don't have kids yet and wanted to try soon.
I spoke to a Mac clinician who said to ask lots of Qs at the meeting with the consultant in the next fornight and ask what the full rationale for the radical is and why we can't have a radixal trachelectomy or egg harvest to protect our chances in the future. I know even with the trach there can be complications conceiving too.
Has anybody any experience of or heard of cases where consultants will re-consider another option to protect our desire to try for a family later.? My wife's health is paramount I just want to know we have explored every option.

Hi all. So I've had pre chemo appt today, bloods all good so ready to go! First chemoradio is Wednesday 14th. I asked at the hospital if there were any creams worth buying to try and prevent burns and they said no don't use any creams at all. However I've seen on different forums people saying that creams really helped so does anyone know whether I should get any or just leave it? Any tips about good things to pack in my bag apart from the obvious entertainment things? Feeling a real mixed bag of emotions about it all. Part of me wants to hurry up and get it over and done with while the other part wants the 14th to never come around!

cervical,Question,Hopingforhappinessandhealth,"Abnormal smear, bleeding and pain","
Hi, I hope this is ok to post here.
I recently had a abnormal smear, with HPV positive and borderline cell changes. My last smear (3 years ago was normal). My dr has referred me to have a colposcopy but not urgently. I’ve also had a bit of bleeding and pain at times.
I’m worried that the lack of urgency will mean it’s too late?
My mum is currently going to Brest cancer treatment, so my anxious levels are very high! I’m hoping someone might have any advice either on how to not worry or what the results and bleeding could mean.
many thanks

cervical,Question,AmgI431,Chemoradiotherapy,"
Hi ladies, 
I am 29 years old and have been diagnosed with a rare type of cervical cancer which is called Neuroendocrine carcinoma at stage 1b2. I had no symptoms just an abnormal smear.
A few weeks ago I had a radical hysterectomy which I am currently recovering from. I found this absolutely devastating and am still really mourning the loss of my reproductive organs. I start chemo radiotherapy in two weeks. I have been told I will be taking two types of chemotherapy drugs - cisplatin and etoposide and it is almost 100% likely that I will lose all of my hair. Cold caps are not an option as etoposide will be a take home tablet. 
I am very upset about this and not really sure how to move forward. I hope that when the time comes I can just embrace it and be strong in the way I see so many others are. I’d be keen to hear about other experiences with hair loss. How soon does the hair fall? How does it fall or does it thin first? Is it better to just shave my head before I see it start? 
I haven’t told many people about my diagnosis. I know that having a shaved head will tell it all. I don’t mind people knowing it’s just the process of telling that I can’t handle. I almost wish I could click my fingers and everyone would just know. Is it a bad idea to wait until they see it for themselves or is it better to warn people first? 
any advice would be appreciated

Cold caps are not an option as etoposide will be a take home tablet. 
I am very upset about this and not really sure how to move forward. I hope that when the time comes I can just embrace it and be strong in the way I see so many others are. I’d be keen to hear about other experiences with hair loss. How soon does the hair fall? How does it fall or does it thin first? Is it better to just shave my head before I see it start? 
I haven’t told many people about my diagnosis. I know that having a shaved head will tell it all. I don’t mind people knowing it’s just the process of telling that I can’t handle. I almost wish I could click my fingers and everyone would just know. Is it a bad idea to wait until they see it for themselves or is it better to warn people first? 
any advice would be appreciated

cervical,Question,NicNak,Diagnosis,"
I have been suffering from heavy periods and discharge since March this year. I tried to make several GP appointments but none available so was asked to see the practice nurse. I broke down at the appointment and told her this was not normal for my body and that i though i had cancer. she explained that it wasn’t anything bad after looking at my cervix and called GP in to have a look and reassure me. They took a smear test at that same appointment. It took 8 weeks for the results which came back HPV positive and was told not to worry and i would be asked to come back for another smear in 12 months. Reassured i was fine i continued with my life but the discharge did not stop. So yet again attempted to make another GP appointment he treated me for thrush, even though i argued that this was not thrush. After the thrush treatment the symptoms were still the same, so again called the GP the nurse then took swabs for infection, that came back clear. I then tried to make another appointment but GP refused to see me face to face and called me to say that he would refer me to a gynaecologist. After a month of chasing again (at this point its October) i finally got to see a gynaecologist in the community. They sent me for an ultrasound scan, this came back and i went for a gynaecologist appointment and biopsy. They caused severe bleeding when trying to get the speculum in place so couldn’t get a sample. Luckily within 2 days of this happening i got to see a wonderful gynaecologist oncologist at hospital. It is now the end of November and i have had a diagnosis for cervical cancer and have a MRI on Thursday-  MDT a week later- appointment to discuss a few days later. I am scared that they have caught this late as this has been going on for 8 months.

cervical,Question,LaraV,Post First LLETZ and waiting for biopsy results,"
Hi everyone , so good to have a community around this to chat to. I have my first LLETZ three weeks ago and still waiting on results of the biopsy. 
seeing the cells was probably the scariest bit. But once they did the LLETZ I felt a little relieved. That said, the wait it awful. I feel very guilty as my last Smear test was in 2016 and I just kept postponing because of work and holiday! Such a stupid decision. 
what happens once you get your biopsy results? Will they tell you what stage the cancer is at? I was told it could still be CIN 3 but they don’t really know until we get the results. And what happens after that? 
I am so so sad and sorry for everyone going through this at various stages- sending lots of strength and courage ! Xxx

cervical,Question,Amp,Can a punch biposy miss Cancer?,"
Hello lovely ladies,
I had a recent smear come back as positive HPV and borderline changes so I then went for a colposcopy and had a punch biopsy.
I was very emotional at the time as my best friend had just passed (days before) from cervical cancer and my results were a huge shock to me having always been clear.
The nurses were lovely but I noted they didn't once actually reassure me that everything looked fine. I saw bleeding on the camera when she first looked at my cerix and then couldn't look anymore.2 weeks later I received a letter showing CIN3- I had gone from clear, to borderline, to Cin3 in 3 years and I feel petrified.
I have many symptoms of cervical cancer and have also felt my cervix, which clearly reveals one side of my cervix is much bigger and lumpy. I'm now thinking why didn't they warn me and what else aren't they telling me?
I've found these forums incredibly helpful and have read stories of others having LEEP (I'm having mine tomorrow) and then detecting cancer. I'm at a point where I have so many symptoms I feel it's inevitable I have cancer.
I think my question here is, can they always 'see' cancer? I want to ask them tomorrow to be brutally honest as the shock is what keeps affecting me the most.I know the symptoms can be other things too, but with the feel of my cervix this will have to be an incredible coincidence.
Any advice will honestly help here.
I'd also like to thank all the incredible women who have shared their experiences on here-you have no idea the impact you have on us newbies.

cervical,Question,Ajay100,Hysteroscopy,"
Hi 
I was referred by my GP for a coloscopy on an urgent 2 week pathway. I had that this morning but the consultant decided she wouldn’t take a cervix biopsy. However, she has booked me in for a general anaesthetic for a hysteroscopy as she said the lining of my womb was thickened - should - should be no more than 4mm but mine was 12mm. So, looks like now attention has moved from cervix to womb. Or have other women had different diagnosis after Hysteroscopy? I was surprised she wanted me to have a general - but not sure if that means a larger biopsy sample will be taken. She did try to take a sample this morning but said she was unable to get the implement into my womb - it was being blocked by something. So the Hysteroscopy will be in next 2 weeks as again still on urgent pathway. I know other conditions such as polyps could cause a thickening of womb but she said “not out of the woods yet, can’t say it’s not cancer at this stage”. I have to say I was very relieved to have a female gynaecologist- I know for some people that’s not important, but for various reasons, it was a big relief for me.

cervical,Question,agathac,Any tips for first day of chemo?,"
Hi
I hope you’re all doing well.
I start chemoradion tomorrow, Monday. The radiotherapy department sent me some information, but I haven’t had much info about the chemo session  (they said a nurse would ring me on Friday, but they didn’t). I know I should wear loose clothes and take a book - is there anything else it would be useful to know? Do I eat a normal breakfast? Should I take a morsel to eat (it starts at 11am and I go straight onto radiotherapy at 4)? 
thank you!

cervical,Question,Lulabell,The next steps after radical hysterectomy,"
Hi everyone,
About a month ago I had my radical hysterectomy and 20 lymph nodes removed here in Italy where I have been living for over twenty years. They removed the tumour from my cervix and found one lymph node which was positive (containing carcinoma cells). Yesterday I had a consultation with the radio therapist and oncologist and they have told me I will need six weeks of radio therapy (everyday Monday to Friday for six weeks) and one chemotherapy once a week for those six weeks, so chemoradiotherapy with Cisplatin, here it's called ""Cisplatino""!
As you know, I wasn't told the stage of my cancer before treatment started, it was just classed as early stage as the tumour was small (1.5 cm) but I read yesterday in my write up that due to the lymph node involvement it's considered FIGO stage 111C1. 
I don't know why, but seeing the stage written down and it being higher than I expected has made me more worried than before. Indeed, I was having trouble sleeping as my brother sent me some 5 year survival statistics which weren't very encouraging at all.
I guess what I'm trying to say is it's only hitting me now how serious this all is and I'm struggling with feelings of fear, guilt and isolation I suppose.
How on earth did a tiny tumour spread to a lymph node???
Thanks and please excuse my rambling,

cervical,Question,FreddieWhippet,Just diagnosed but possible other issues,"

Hello. I was diagnosed with cervical cancer on 23 May. Prior to that I was diagnosed with an infection after my LLETZ and the antibiotics given for that caused severe infection. My diagnosis was therefore coupled with feeling very unwell and swollen. I’ve had my MRI and been told one of my ovaries looks suspicious and is causing ascites fluid in my abdomen. It’s agony and is being drained tomorrow. I’m just scared I may have ovarian cancer too! I googled ascites and scared myself half to death. Has anyone else had anything similar? thank you for reading

Hi all,

im new here, I fell down the Google rabbit hole and the thought maybe coming here would help with my anxiety. So a little about my situation. I have bleeding in between periods and heavy periods also am in my period more then I am off. I went to my gp and have now been referred to a gynaecologist. I seen them yesterday they are sending me for a biopsy and ultrasound. My main question is that they did a vaginal exam and in there dr talk for there notes I heard them say my cervix and womb is inflamed. Is this something that anyone has had and can I be blunt ans ask did that lead to a cervical cancer diagnosis?? That is just where my brain has gone and I’m so worried. Just wondered if anyone else had the same.

Thank you in advance to anyone who could help x

cervical,Question,S.71,Diagnosed with stage3c cervical cancer,"
Hi,
My mum was diagnosed with stage 3c grade 2 cervical cancer last week. It has spread to some pelvic lymph nodes. Before the diagnosis, she had abnormal bleeding and lower back pain. But now the symptoms have gotten worse. She has lower abdominal pain and sometimes pain radiating in the upper back/spine area and around calves? Has anyone with a similar case had these symptoms? Does this mean the cancer is spreading now? And are there any studies that look at how fast cancer can spread from stage 3 to 4?
The MDT meeting about her case took place yesterday and she got referred to another hospital. How long does it take for the treatment to start? 
Thanks

cervical,Question,Jodie1995,Could my symptoms be Cervical Cancer ?,"
Hi all,
Firstly, I do not have a diagnosis of cervical cancer. Instead I am just looking for some truthful answers to put my mind at rest a little or to educate me. I am 26 years old.
I have recently contacted my doctor due to feeling unwell for a long period of time. My periods have always been extremely irregular and at times I have not had one for 6 months. However, recently I have been having periods which are extremely frequent and long. I have recently had a period which lasted around 4 and a half months which is not normal for myself.
I left this for quite a while and was noticing spotting in between my periods also. I have also experienced different types of discharge some yellow and others a dark brown, this has an unpleasant smell. 
The reason for going to my GP was due to not only my extremely long period but also that I noticed I had a constant dull ache in my lower back and the top of my legs, I wouldn’t describe this as a pain but more like a noticeable ache which becomes worse if I’m laying down. Recently I have felt extremely tired and suddenly feel sick but it then disappears, at times I find myself sweating throughout the night.
I have recently had my first cervical examination and smear test and was told the doctor could see a polyp on my cervix and was questioning wether to refer me to the gynaecologist or for a colposcopy I can’t remember her decision as I was flustered. I began bleeding again after the exam and informed my doctor I had developed what appeared to be a wart on the outside of my anus. Sorry for to much information.
I have not been on any contraception for 4 years and all my other tests came back negative such as bloods and hormones. Is it possible this could all be effects of cervical polyps or could this be cervical cancer ? 
Im now awaiting my results for my smear test and to know what comes next, my family feel I’m being paranoid which I probably am! I just feel their is a lot going on and that I haven’t felt ‘normal’ for quite some time.
I appreciate any replies.

cervical,Question,,Could this be cervical cancer? Extremely worried :(,"
Hi everyone,
I'm terrified about what my symptoms could mean and still haven't found any answers. About 4 or 5 months ago I started getting blood in urine and some spotting, I did many urine tests and blood tests which came back with a combination of white and red blood cells. They gave me antibiotics and concluded it was an infection - the blood went. Blood tests came back normal.
Months later I started getting cramps, strange gushes of discharge (watery, lasted longer than typical ovulation) which felt like I was peeing myself. Sorry for tmi, but it did not smell like urine and had more of a sweet scent. I'm only 27 so was obviosuly really freaked out by this. I also noticed slight pain after sex and peeing. I saw a gp who was very very dismissive and rude about the whole thing - she told me the discharge was normal, it was probably stress, dismissed cramps for constipation, etc. It was only after paying private to see a gynecologist that he sent a letter to my GP asking for a referral for both a pelvic exam (I had the abdominal one rather than transvaginal) and a urinary tract one. All I received back from both was a message from GP saying ""ultrasounds were normal"". I'm still having gushes of what seems like discharge (tested negative for BV, had pessaries for thrush which haven't seemed to work). It doesn't have a strong odour. I also feel bloated and tired.
My main worry here is that they didn't do a transvaginal scan as part of the ultrasound, only the external one to show the pelvis. Surely they would have looked at my cervix, but I'm worried it needs checking again. Are these types of pelvic scans good at detecting possible cervical cancer? GPs and a gyn have all looked at my cervix and haven't alerted me of anything abnormal or felt anything weird so does this mean it's unlikely to be cc?
I can't ignore the weird discharge leakages and cramps anymore and it's really impacting me mentally (which the GP liked to blame for me seemingly imagining these symptoms in the first place). I haven't had any bleeding for a good few months (other than menstruation), nor blood in urine. My main worries now are feeling bloated, cramps, excessive discharge and some weird feeling after peeing, similar to uti but when checked at the doctor's it comes back negative for a urine infection.
I had my last smear test, and first smear test, around 3 years ago (I think) and I've just turned 27 so should be due another soonish. Can I request one to look at my cells? I've tested negative a number of times for any stis (it's the only thing my GPS seem to want to look at).
Could it be recurring thrush? If anyone could help, that would be amazing as I'm panicking and struggling to sleep or function worrying about it all. Both grandmas on each of my parents' sides died from bowel cancer, though I'm not sure if that plays a part.
Thanks

I can't ignore the weird discharge leakages and cramps anymore and it's really impacting me mentally (which the GP liked to blame for me seemingly imagining these symptoms in the first place). I haven't had any bleeding for a good few months (other than menstruation), nor blood in urine. My main worries now are feeling bloated, cramps, excessive discharge and some weird feeling after peeing, similar to uti but when checked at the doctor's it comes back negative for a urine infection.
I had my last smear test, and first smear test, around 3 years ago (I think) and I've just turned 27 so should be due another soonish. Can I request one to look at my cells? I've tested negative a number of times for any stis (it's the only thing my GPS seem to want to look at).
Could it be recurring thrush? If anyone could help, that would be amazing as I'm panicking and struggling to sleep or function worrying about it all. Both grandmas on each of my parents' sides died from bowel cancer, though I'm not sure if that plays a part.
Thanks

It might sound stupid but I am terrified I am going to bleed to death if I can’t tell the difference. Also a lot of discharge and a metal type smell. Is that also normal?

cervical,Question,,Waiting times,"
I received my diagnosis on Wednesday (2A cervical cancer) and was told at the meeting with the specialist that I would be having a PET CT scan asap then probably radiotherapy and chemotherapy within the next few weeks. I was contacted yesterday by my Macmillan nurse wondering if I had heard about the scan which I haven't and to tell me that I might have to wait until late December for my appointment with the Oncologist. Im worried sick... I felt I had a fighting chance when I was at the initial meeting and everyone seemed to be so on it but now I just feel terrified Im being left... Is it normal to wait so long?

cervical,Question,,Colposcopy showed I may have an area of early cervical cancer,"
Hi I'm looking for some advice and so reassurance if possible please. 
I have always had normal regular smear tests until my recent one.
It came back as high grade servere dyskaryosis and hpv positive. 
I was sent for a colposcopy last week and it was the worst experience of my life.  I recieved zero compassion,  I had 4 people in the room  one was training . The colposcopy nurse said I did have high grade servere dyskaryosis but there was a small area higher up that looked like early cervical cancer it may be high grade cells but she wanted to be honest with me. 
I tried to ask questions obviously I was very upset and she didn't answer my questions and still I received no compassion or any words to even reassure. 
I left in a mess and was inconsolable,  my eldest son made a complaint on my behalf about the way I was treated. 
Since then the lady who received the complaint called me and arranged for a gynecological doctor to call me to explain. 
She was lovely but did say some microscopic cancer cells were found on my smear test but was telling me not to worry I will be having a LLETZ under general anaesthetic. 
Obviously now I am thinking the worst and they found something on smear and colposcopy. 
Please can anyone advise me and share their own experiences. 
I have 3 younger children under 8 as well as my older son so I'm trying to be brave but I'm a mess. 
Thank you xx

cervical,Question,Joix21,Low uptake PET,"
Hi all,
I was diagnosed with cervical cancer in July and finished my chemo radiation treatment a few weeks ago. At my pet scan in July, I was told there was low uptake in my bowel, the caecum area. My oncologist asked for advice from a bowel specialist who said that occasionally abnormalities show up in the bowel on a pet scan and since it didn’t show up on my CT scan it’s unlikely to be cancer. He recommended that I have a colonoscopy after my treatment to double check which I’m having done this week. Does anyone know, if it’s not cancerous what it could be? I can’t find any info about this online. Thank you.

cervical,Question,,Colposcopy nightmare :-(,"
Hello I’m hoping that one of you lovely community member can reassure me or advise me.
it’s a long story so I’m really sorry.
I was raped in 2016, and after lots of painful examination etc was advised I had The hpv virus, it was never fully explained to me at the time and with everything else I had going on I never fully looked in to what it was. I also avoided smears, as mad as it may sound Now and I feel stupid for saying it, I didn’t want anyone down there doing that again until was ready. Just before Xmas of this year I plucked up the courage and went for my smear, the nurse started by talking me though hpv and I told her I already knew I had this, I explained my situation to her and she fully understood. She took the smear and advised me I may be called for a smear ever year. My results came back telling me I had CIN 2 high grade cells and hpv, I was booked in for colposcopy. I went on jan 26th. Nothing was explained to me, the doctor became angry when I told her me and my husband were trying for a baby for the last 18 months. Told me to stop immediately and use condoms until I had a 12 month clear smear test. I told her about my rape and that I know suffer with PTSD and that I do experience pain in sex but I thought it was psychological. During my colposcopy she didn’t speak or explain anything to me, I had some massive stabbing pains to which I looked up, she had blood all over her Tools, and she shouted at me to put my head down and look at the wall. I was crying by this point. She then stopped and said she was stopping the procedure as she could see any high grade cells so she had taken a couple of punch biopsy’s. I asked if it meant that i was ok and had no high grade cells she said “no” I asked her what that meant and she repeated again the bit above to me again. She said I would get my results in the post and again stressed condoms to be used from now on. that was all I was told 
now 3 weeks later I’ve had a letter but with any results just a generic letter telling me to come for a colposcopy in 4 weeks time? I’m so totally confused! And a bit upset about the way the dr was and the support I’ve received, also I’ve had some terrible nightmares since where my husband tells me I’m screaming in my sleep! I’m so sorry for long post.

cervical,Question,,Hysterectomy recovery,"
Hi, I have my surgery coming up for a full hysterectomy. I know everyone is different and so recovery is different for each person but I'm looking for a bit of a clearer idea of what recovery is like.
I know I won't be able to bend or lift for a while but that's all I know really and I'm changing my house and moving things around so that I can avoid those things and I have grabbing stick from when I broke my leg too.  
I (very happily) live by myself so my dad,  brother and me are planning when they come stay with me. Will I need someone with me all the time? Or just for the first few days? I have volunteers chores so I'm not worried about that. 
Any help will be appreciated! 
Thanks,

Hi
I’m scheduled for keyhole radical hysterectomy on Friday. My consultant said I would likely be discharged next day! Was anyone else discharged so quickly? The friend who was going to help me get home Saturday has just had to go into isolation for COVID. At such short notice I’m really struggling to find anyone else to come to the hospital to collect me. How feasible is it for me to leave hospital with my bag and get home via a cab on my own? (I’ll have support at home) I know it’s not ideal but am I kidding myself that it’s even possible to do that bit alone the day after the op? I’m 48, 1A2 and normally fit and healthy.Thanks in advance for your views

cervical,Question,,Scared before surgery,"
I was diagnosed on February 16th with cervical cancer. I’ve had 2 MRIs and a CT scan and it is a 2cm tumour that hasn’t spread. My local hospital referred me to Sheffield and then Sheffield has since referred me to the Royal Marsden for a trachelectomy as I am 31 and we don’t have any children yet. 
I am glad that at the moment we are hopeful the trachelectomy will be possible in April however I am petrified at the thought of lymphodema after the surgery, I am scared for the scarring which I will have which I know is superficial but it bothers me. I am getting myself so worked up with worry I am constantly crying. my husband is a great support but I am struggling with not seeing my friends and family and having any form of face to face support from anyone else 
can anyone offer thoughts on the surgery, the lymph node removal and risks or good news on this or the post surgery aspects of a catheter etc as I am really struggling with overthinking and thinking of the worst case scenarios.

cervical,Question,,voluntary lymphadenectomy,"
Hello everyone, 
I'm glad there is a community to reach out to here. I've read some sad but also inspiring stories, I hope you can also help me. 
I was diagnosed with cervical cancer in October 2020 and believe that has been cured now. I've been told there is a 2-3% chance that the cancer could have moved to my lymph nodes and so the doctors have recommended removing them to be 100% sure I am cured. However, I have also been told that there is a 10-20% chance of getting Lymphoedema from the surgery. I don't want to be left with incurable cancer if it has moved to my lymphnodes but am also worried about the long term effects of Lymphoedema. 
Can anyone tell me if they have been in my position and what decision they made? 
I am also happy to answer any questions anyone might have about LLETZ procedures.

Hi 
I had an HPV positive smear last year. In August last year I decided after years of trying to conceive and fertility treatment that I couldn’t do it anymore and decided to have a coil fitted to help with my terrible periods. As soon as I had the coil fitted my periods stopped and i actually felt normal for the first time in ages, not dreading every month. I started to bleed daily in December and it continued so I called my GP who wasn’t worried but said he would speak to a gynaecologist and get back to me. I had a call back and the gynaecologist said to attend and have my cervix checked. I had the appointment last week and the nurse said my cervix did not look normal and she is worried about cervical cancer and that I would be referred on a 2 week wait. I have now received an appointment for next week but it is a telephone consultation not a face to face. can anyone explain what to expect as I am terrified and confused and not sure what happens next.

cervical,Question,Moneypenny79,Day 4 post results,"
Day 4 after LLETS and biopsy, still can't talk about it without crying but it's got me thinking about the stages of smear test to diagnosis.
I had my routine smear on 12th November 20, no letter or communication from my GP since with any results which usually means all is well, previous blood tests for other things in October 20 showing no issues weren't communicated in writing, it's just how they do things I think, but then I got a call from the hospital on 23rd December asking me to make an urgent app for further investigation, luckily they could fit me in a week later which was brilliant, but why had no one from my GP been in touch with the results of the smear?  Usually these are available 2 weeks after the smear has been done?  Has any one else experienced this?
I didn't know how serious things were until I got to the hospital on 31st and the Consultant explained hat was happening and going to happen, on one hand this was OK as it didn't spoil the already strange Christmas we were having but on the other hand I would have appreciated a bit more warning, time to get my head around it and talk to my GP before the hospital visit.
I'm now in a waiting game for the results of my biopsy, should hear something back after next Wednesday.

Of course I had the procedure done. Dr was fab no pain and I felt really reassured all irregular cells had been removed. Was advised by after care nurse I would receive a letter with my results within 6 -8 weeks and be called back for a smear within 6 months. 4 weeks pass and the Doctor called me for an appointment to dicuss my results. Within the biopsy they found 2 areas of cancer. Now I have to wait until January for a repeat colposcopy to make sure all cancer has been removed. My heads all over the place will they have got all the cancer or is there more that was never seen as the cancer found within the biopsy was so small even my doctor was shocked.

cervical,Question,,Recurrence of Cervical Cancer,"
Hi all, 
My mother was diagnosed with Cervical Cancer at Xmas after many months of not feeling well, weight loss etc. She completed 6 sessions of Chemo in June and started Avestin pretty much straight away. Although we knew the likelihood of her cancer returning eventually was high (based on what we've been told by her consultant, late diagnosis being the main issue), we were still very shocked to be told today that it's returned, just 4 months after chemo finished!
Her consultant has told her she will need a CT scan and then will start another round of chemo straight away. He says the amount of cancer is small (so small that when she completed treatment in June it was not even visible) and therefore she may 'only' need two rounds of chemo. 
Her markers when she started treatment were 7,000, they were 2,000 when she finished and are now at 2,050 so not a big increase. 
My Mum is obviously gutted (as we all are) but is determined to carry on with the chemo ASAP. 
If anyone has any experience of cancer returning so soon after treatment, and can offer any advice it would be greatly appreciated. 
Thank you xx

cervical,Question,,Lletz after normal smear??,"
Hi all so quick back story, since age 20 I’ve had gynae issues, between age 20 & 25 i had 3 lletz procedures. Last year (age 36) i was diagnosed with vin3 & had a WLE operation in December. I had more biopsies done in July and the vin is back so going in for more surgery in 4 days time. After my last colposcopy & smear (July) i Received a letter (copy of gp letter) saying that a vulva lesion was found, my cervix could only be partially visualised & my vaginal wall couldn’t be examined. This hasn’t been explained to me. So I went for my pre op on Friday and was asked if I understood the procedure I’m having done so i said yes (assuming it was just another wle) but it turns out on the paperwork I’m having a colposcopy, excision of vulva lesion & Lletz treatment. My smear test came back normal but with high risk HPV. I don’t understand why I’m having a lletz when my smear was normal? Has this happened to any of you? Thanks x

I was diagnosed with cervical cancer in March this year just 6 months after having my little girl. I'd had a complicated delivery which lead to further investigations with the outcome something I never expected to hear.
I dont think I have actually dealt with hearing the words you have stage 2 cervical cancer because as soon as I was diagnosed we were suddenly in lockdown due to covid.  I have finished my radiotherapy and chemotherapy but found this extremely difficult as I wasnt able to have anyone there supporting me or asking the difficult questions to the consultant thay i was too scared to asked because I'm not sure i wanted to know the answer.  I'm not sure how in feeling one minute I exceot it and the next I'm mad at the world, as I am only 29 and also had the HPV vaccine as a teenager so on my bad days nothing makes sense. I keep being told this is normal but that doesn't always help.
I am 13 days post treatment now and still seem to be struggling with everything. My body is physically exhausted and I'm not sure what to do to stop feeling so tired all the time. I am falling asleep at the strangest of times and places. Please tell me this is normal...

I have learnt so much from you all in this time and am so thankful for this and the flashes of positivity from hearing from those living life whilst battling and surviving. I am trying to prepare myself for what is to come, but have a query. Initially I was told to expect chemo then surgery and then more chemo. This seems to be very common and I understand the particular cocktail of chemo will be dependent on the cancer. However, last discussion indicated I may go straight to surgery and then likely chemo. My understanding is that May because they can’t get a biopsy from the mass/anywhere else and this is why I have been tormented by waiting on womb biopsy took on admission. can anyone let me know if one route of treatment is seen as more effective than another? What is implication for surgery prior to chemo?

my mum started her chemo today (carboplatin & paclitaxel) after a full debulking 8 weeks ago, she’s stage 3c high grade serous.
About an hour into treatment her kidneys decided they didn’t like it, she said she felt like they were going to explode. She was taken off chemo, had an antihistamine and a 30 minute break and then back on. She was able to last the rest of the treatment and is now back home.
the nurses told her this is quite normal for the first round as your body reacts to it, but I just wanted to ask if anyone else had experienced this and if it caused any issues for subsequent treatment? She is due to have 6 rounds in total and then 2 years on PARPs.

Thank you to all who have replied to messages up to now. Mum had her debulking surgery (full hysterectomy, omentum & peritoneal areas removed) 9th Dec. All visible disease removed. We met with the professor today who informed us it’s stage 3c high grade serous.
Chemo will be standard carboplatin & paclitaxel 6 rounds starting next Thursday, and then 2 years of PARP inhibitors.
Have obviously been given all the run down of possible side effects, food tolerance changes, hair loss etc. but just wondering if anyone able to share any experiences and also anything that helped them lessen side effects?
Mum (63) is really fit and hugely active, wants to keep going to the gym etc and of course really want to support that. How much of a normal life were you able to stick to? Immediate days following treatment notwithstanding.
Thanks so much,

ovarian,Question,Snow88,Managing Symptoms - Elderly Relative,"
Good Evening
I have joined this group as a relative in her mid 80s has been diagnosed with stage 3 ovarian cancer. She has had a number of scans and biopsies in the last 10 weeks. We are hoping to hear of her latest biopsy result next week. As yet, treatment options have not been discussed.
At her last biopsy, the nurse noticed the build of fluid on her abdomen and she was advised to have this drained. It hadn’t been mentioned to  her before. She felt very poorly and was given a hospital appt a few days later where they drained 8l of ascites. 
I can’t help but feel her cancer is marching on while she awaits a specific diagnosis. How can we help her manage her symptoms while she waits? Is there anyone we can reach out to? Or is it just a case of having to wait until treatment is scheduled?
Very grateful for any advice or experience you can share. My best wishes to those undergoing treatment at the moment xx

ovarian,Question,Blackpepper,Investigations due to high level CA125 and symptoms,"
Good evening. I’m reaching out to see if anyone else has had similar experiences and can offer advice.
i went to gp with pain in lower abdomen, intermittent bleeding, bloating, change in bowel habits and fatigue. I had urine test followed by CA125. My initial level was 360. Following this I was referred for an ultrasound scan. I struggled with this scan due to the amount of water I had to consume and was so desperate for a wee. They had to ask me to empty my bladder as they said my tummy was too swollen. On examination the consultant stated there was no cysts and my ovaries were an average size. a further CA125 test was completed and my level was 180 odd, definitely an improvement. However due to ongoing symptoms I was referred to gyni at the local hospital. The consultant was lovely and said they weren’t overly concerned. I had a endometrial biopsy on my uterus and some 6 weeks later I have been advised that there was nothing of concern there, however due to my last (3rd) CA125 reading being 580, she has referred me for a CT scan this week. I spoke with her briefly as this has definitely been a slow process since my initial presentation to gp in March. I feel assured if there was any concern things would have been expedited?
the consultant did mention that if the CT scan didn’t show anything of concern, she would speak to me regarding an op to remove my ovaries/tubes. I guess as a form of reducing further risks.
can anyone offer any advice please?

ovarian,Question,Trudyx,Pre-assessment,"
Hi,
I have been booked in for surgery on Saturday to have an ovarian cancer removed. The tumour has pushed in to my bowel also, therefore this will involve bowel surgery as well. I haven't yet heard about a pre-assessment which is leaving me a bit concerned as I know that I may need to follow a specific diet and possibly have antibiotics.
Just wandering whether I'm being a bit premature with my concerns?

I have posted before but my situation has changed.
I'm reaching out to anyone who identifies with the following 
At the beginning of 2024 had spotting so saw Dr- probably hormonal (I'm 68) so don't worry - come back if it gets worse!
Over the next few months it was nothing major so just tried to ignore.  In July spotting increased so went back and was fast tracked to UCHgynae - saw dr 2 weeks later who did internal scan and said all looks OK.
2 wks later still not good so fast tracked again to UCH and saw consultant who checked again and said hormonal - use hrt cream down below!!!
Summer/holidays came and went and then 1 day in Nov I had major bleed - fed up with allsorts checking down below decided to go private.
Saw private gynaecologist at beginning of December who checked and did biopsy - this came back with cancer!! So told I would have to have radical womb surgery but would probably be able to have keyhole and be in hospital for a couple of days. 
Then had to have mri/ct with contrast which showed much more cancer beyond uterus, tumour in area etc 
Now I'm facing major surgery- the consultant didn't spare anything at our meeting- probably in hospital for at least a week with long recovery and then chemo
I'm terrified- anyone out there been through anything like this!

ovarian,Question,Sooey,Swelling on scan,"
Hi there, I've had an ultrasound for postmenopausal bleeding and there is a swelling on my tube/ovary, that wasn't there 18 months ago when I had a scan for a polyp.
I'm awaiting ca125 result, however I have two symptoms, one that my GP has dismissed as just 'getting older' for a while now.
I've had groin ache in the creases of my leg/body joint, sometimes quite badly and it's been there permanently for months. I didn't mention it to the specialist as I was in a bit of shock from the ultrasound scan and was being whizzed from one person to the next.
Could this groin ache be a symptom of the swelling, benign or otherwise? I've read about lower abdominal pain being a symptom, I occasionally get the odd fleeting stabbing in the lower abdomen and a bit of an ache coming and going, but this groin pain is consistently there.
Additionally, for a while now, I've had up to 1100 WBC in my urine, without any infection, which my GP has scratched their head about. Could this in any way be linked to the swelling?
The reason I ask is, the consultant said if the ca125 comes back ok they're just leaving it at that, no further testing, but I've read that ca125 isn't always an indicator of a problem and I'm worried these other things could be related.

ovarian,Question,M1234,PARP inhibitors versus surgery,"
Hi all, my mum is currently having chemo for stage 4b ovarian cancer. She was told initially surgery was not an option, but fortunately she has responded so well to the chemo that they are now considering surgery. It’s a bit confusing though because the oncologist seemed to say that the surgery wouldn’t improve her overall prognosis, and that taking PARP inhibitors is such an effective way of managing ovarian cancer, the outcome would be the same whether or not she had surgery.
Does anyone know any more about this or have any information on effectiveness of PARP inhibitors versus surgery?

ovarian,Question,lilyov,Allergic reaction to Paclitaxel - others experiences with what happens next?,"
Hi everyone,
I've had my first chemotherapy infusion and due to have second one tomorrow, but I had an allergic reaction to Paclitaxel which was stopped (and went back for Carboplatin the next day which was fine).
I was told I'd get a call from my team but didn't, I emailed them and got some replies a week later, but my clinic call yesterday was a bit of a surprise:
I've been told they want to stop the Paclitaxel completely (I was initially told I had a mild reaction - after 20 mins of infusion and no adrenaline needed - my own was enough!) but now they are saying it was a moderate/severe reaction - I want them to try it again but they say it's too risky.
I've been told I can't have nabpaclitaxel / abraxane (Paclitaxel for those with allergic reactions) because this trust does not give it for ovarian cancer
I want to trust my team but I have heard of others getting to try Paclitaxel again ('rechallenge') or having abraxane - be really curious to hear your experiences...
Thanks so much for sharing what you'd like to

ovarian,Question,thelittlewarrior98,Olaparib/Lynparza Treatment Tablets,"
Heyy guys,
Has anyone else ever had to take these Olaparib/Lynparza treatment tablets before?? If so have ya'll ever really suffered from them and if you have suffered from them then what did you do/take instead like what are the alternatives??
I have Stage 4 Serous Carcinoma Ovarian Cancer and I was first prescribed 300mg of these tablets about 2 months ago and I took them for a couple of weeks but they just made me feel incredibly rubbish like I was just soooo so tired and out of energy all the time and I felt really nauseous and could barely eat like there was literally one day were all I ate was a banana which definitely isn't great at all, especially when I've literally been trying to gain weight!!
I just wasn't functioning like a regular human being anymore, so I stopped taking the tablets as advised by the doctors and I immediately felt soooo so much better and went back to normal again within a few days!
I had my regular treatment (Avastin/Bev) thy I usually have every 3 weeks on Thursday after just over a month delay and they gave me two new boxes of the same tablets but this time they've lowered it by 50mg, so I now have 250mg instead of 300mg and I've been taking these for about 4 days now (since Thursday night) and I once again just feel absolutely rubbish! I'm extremely tired and have no energy whatsoever, my body is always really achey, I have no thoughts or emotions anymore and I always feel really nauseous and can barely eat again!!
I've been trying soooo so hard to get my life back again after this absolutely horrendous year and I finally almost felt like a normal and somewhat healthy 26 year old human once again, but now after these tablets I just feel like I'm going backwards and back to where I was at the beginning of the year when I was very seriously ill and it's just soooo so frustrating and disheartening for me and even my family 
We're gunna give the tablets a week and if I'm still bad then I'm just gunna stop them as I really don't wanna be feeling all ill and rubbish over Christmas, especially as I already sadly missed Christmas last year due to being very seriously ill (I was diagnosed with Cancer in March/April this year)
My parents are gunna ring up my team at the Cancer centre to see what they say and stuff anyway, but we were just wondering if anyone else has had to take these tablets and how they've affected you and what you did about it or what alternatives there are and stuff if they were also rubbish for any of you??

ovarian,Question,Cheekkat,Finally ovarian origin for my GI Mucinous adenocarcinoma,"
Following my MOAS and CRS and HIPEC at Basingstoke  I've been told that my primary cancer had it's origin deep within my ovarian tumour ( kruckenburgs) and did not originate in my appendix.
The type of cancer was a Gastrointestinal type and this is likely to have mutated from an ovarian germ cell.
The cancer is extremely rare and it appears that the oncologist have had to decide whether to treat me for GI type cancer or ovarian 
It's seems most likely it's going to be Gynae for ovarian.
This means I'll be receiving ovarian targeted chemotherapy  such as pacitaxol and not Folfori for colorectal origins. 
Also I wonder where this puts me as a Pseudomyxoma Peritoni survivor. I had mets to my  peritoneum and omentum which were removed and my tumour removal score was CC0 meaning all cancer was removed.
I also wonder ,  how effective the HIPEC chemo bath which is mitomycin is against my cancer type? If mine is ovarian origin.
Generally feeling fairly defeated. I'm having miserable bowel issues as I had a lower anterior resection of my rectum as my tumour had affixed itself to the outside of my rectum.
Has anyone else had this rare type of cancer?
Feel a bit alone with it.
Also I would like to know what others experience of pacitaxol was, as I've been told its going to be pretty tough. I believe I'll have 6 cycles.

ovarian,Question,Cadence,Seeking pragmatic information on possible treatments and trials,"
Dearest community,
I am rarely on message boards, not because I don't want to offer or receive support, but because they terrify me and plunge me into panic and despair. I am feeling psychologically fragile, and need to maintain a glimmer of hope just in order to get through my day and maintain a positive outlook on my chances of survival. I say this because I have a question for you, but I want to ask you to please not share with me information that will make me lose hope, and to just stick to practical information. I think we all need to find ways to keep hope alive!
In short, what I am seeking is information on what treatments those of you with platinum-resistant high-grade serous cancer have tried when chemo stopped working. I am currently having my second recurrence (third time with HGSOC) and I am being treated with weekly taxol. I am hoping the taxol will work. But in the case that it doesn't, I would love to hear what treatments or trials you have tried if you have reached a similar stage of treatment. It would help me psychologically to know that there are things I can try if taxol doesn't work. I would be very grateful for information about things you are trying or have heard of.
I am currently living in France, and have moved my treatment from the UK to France, but perhaps many of the same trials going on in the UK are also happening in France. And perhaps I can find some of the same treatments here.
Thank you very much. And bon courage to you in finding light in the darkness!

ovarian,Question,enlightened_penguin,ovarian cancer - access to PARP inhibitors,"
Hi,
My mum went in for risk reduction surgery to have her Ovaries and Fallopian tubes removed.
They then tested the removed tissue and found high grade cancer in the tubes.
This fact makes her cancer at least Stage 2.
We got a PET/CT scan following the operation which shows two Lymph nodes are prominent and likely cancer has spread there.
This would upgrade her cancer to Stage 3, but they will not do this without biospy or (surgery) full staging.
My mum does not want to have any surgery. She has complications from before and is very afraid.
She has BRCA 2 gene, so best treatment option for her is Chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors.
But PARP inhibitors are only offered on the NHS for Stage 3 or above Ovarian cancer.
If during Chemotherapy, the lymph nodes seem to respond i.e. indicating cancer is/was there, is this enough ammunition to go to the oncologist to ask/demand they stage the cancer to 3 so we have access to PARP inhibitors?
It seems logical to me.
The NHS only have a guideline for the prescription of PARP inhibitors for their limited resource (£) purposes.
I am of the opinion an oncologist could prescribe if they are satisfied she is likely Stage 3 with whatever evidence they seem fit.
And, anyone know if PARP inhibitors are started during Chemotherapy or after?
Your feedback is welcome .
Thanks.

ovarian,Question,Noodleface,Gloriosa clinical trial,"
Morning all,
Quick background summary: stage 3c HGSOC diagnosed Oct 2023, debulking surgery Nov 23, chemo ended April 24, been on Niraparib since May 24, latest NED scan Aug 24. BRCA neg and HRD neg.
I get 4-weekly blood tests due to still being fairly early days on Niraparib. Two weeks ago my CA-125 had shot up to 110, following previous month at 33, and single figures before then. Latest CT scan this month shows early stages of first recurrence in different sites, which is a huge disappointment after such a short time. I see my consultant tomorrow for all the details and a discussion about what happens next. However, I had already spoken to a CNS on the phone on Thursday and asked her to give me the headlines of my results over the phone. She had been in the MDT meeting during which they'd looked at my scan and discussed it. Apparently, if chemo is the decision (carbo/caelyx) then I might be offered the chance to go onto the Gloriosa clinical trial as well. This is fairly newish, I think, and currently open to people with my profile.
So just wondering if any of you have been on it, are on it or had it suggested please? What's your experience?

Hello all, I’m 41 and new to the group. I’ve been diagnosed with ovarian cancer in July and went through surgery in September (full hysterectomy as well as part of of the peritoneum have been removed, in order to remove all organs, I have also had ended with a stoma). I’ve been told in general surgery was successful and now started my chemo. However although I was planned to have paclitaxel and carboplatin, I had allergic reaction to the paclitaxel and now it needs to be decided on alternative medicine and whether such to be given at all. Is there any of you who has been going through the same, and if so, what has been given to you as alternative to the paclitaxel as chemo please?

ovarian,Question,Xena WP,Stage 4- Chemo only,"
Hi All,  
Around Jan 24 I started to feel unwell , I already have an incurable (but manageable)blood cancer unfortunately this was originally misdiagnosed as kidney cancer resulting in my kidney and spleen being removed (2018) 
I went to the GP and had various blood tests which were abnormal so referred to hospital and following several scans, biopsies including drainage of ascities I was eventually diagnosed (Mar 24) with stage 4 Ovarian Cancer spread throughout abdomen, omentum, liver and diaphram, I was booked for a debulking and full hysterectomy in Apr 24 and although opened up they were unable to complete due to legacy from my previous kidney removal op.
My next treatment is palliative chemo starting next week I am actually looking forward to getting this to try and reduce some of the tumours and fight back in some way.  If successful, there may be targeted therapy following so maybe not so final.  I was wondering if any of you guys had only had chemo without the Op and if so how did you get on.   Thanksxx

ovarian,Question,igotyou,Stage 3 Ovarian Cancer - too extensive for surgery & thinking of refusing chemo,"
My Mum is, or rather was until recently, a spritely 77 year old lady. She was diagnosed with stage 3 Ovarian Cancer, last Friday 4 October. We're told it's too extensive, throughout her pelvic region though not impacting on any other organs, for surgery. However, they can offer chemo. If it shrinks enough, surgery may be a later option. Well, in short she's comtemplating refusing the treatment. Says she's had a good life & she'd rather end it on a good note, than end up suffering further pain, side efffects & ... Well this one of the problems, we don't know what to expect! We're a small family (Im an only child, with an only child) & have been lucky enough to not have any experience of cancer to now. Second problem is that, despite over 50 years of strong & loving marraige, my Mum doesn't know how to tell my Dad whats on her mind. He's always been the one to make all the decisions & she knows he'll expect her to fight it all the way ... regardless of what this entails. I'm the only one who knows what Mums thinking.

ovarian,Question,Scottish81,Back to front,"
Hi, 
Feeling in a muddle tonight.
I'm under the Gynae Oncology team but don't yet have a diagnosis, was seeing Gynaecologist for heavy periods that my GP didn't know how to treat due to previous breast cancer. Had had an ultrasound in July which showed a 'simple cyst' slightly larger than normal but not a cause for concern, advice was rescan in 3 months. In meantime, I was referred to gynaecology who requested blood tests ans d a hysteroscopy. 
Hysteroscopy came back normal but Ca125 came back 'slightly raised', I don't know the numbers yet, so was referred for a CT scan.
Got a call a few weeks ago from specialist nurse saying I'd been referred to Gynae Oncology, CT shows a 4.7 cm lesion on left hand of womb (is this the cyst?!), they don't know if benign or not, and that I would need a hysterectomy, she said consultant appointment would be sent out.
I now have pre-op assessment tomorrow but don't see consultant until Wednesday. Which seems a bit back to front!
In recent experience, how long is pre-op before surgery date?

ovarian,Question,Alf0d,Low haemoglobin on Niraparib,"
Hi all
I was diagnosed with Stage 4 ovarian cancer in September 2022. Two operations and two cycles of chemo later (the first was only 4 out of the proposed 6 due to a infection that led to hospitalisation) I began on the maintenance treatment Niraparib. 
Increased blood pressure (never had any issues with my blood pressure previously) led to me begin on Amlodipine and my dose of Niraparib went down from 300mg to 200mg.
All seemed to have settled down but then a blood test showed that my haemoglobin level had dropped to 61g/L. I had a call from the chemo unit to go to A&E immediately for 2 units of blood via transfusion.
I have since had 2 further units of blood and my haemoglobin level has reached 96g/L (120 - 150 g/L is the normal haemoglobin range for women).
I am recommencing the Niraparib from Friday at a 100mg dose. Has anyone else on here experienced fatigue due to chemotherapy-induced anemia (CIA)? I was working from home and then working for 16 hours over 4 days prior to the CIA diagnosis. 
If so, how long did it take for energy levels to build back up? I am able to do stuff as long as I take rests in between but don't seem to yet be feeling as if I'm progressing to the higher sustained levels of energy that would allow me to go back to work. 
Any advice/accounts of how others have coped would be gratefully received.

ovarian,Question,Champika,Ovarian Cancer and bevacizumab,"
My mother is a stage 3C ovarian cancer patient (primary peritoneal), diagnosed in January 2023. She underwent first-line chemotherapy (6 cycles) and debulking surgery. Afterward, she was monitored with ultrasound scans, which identified a recurrence of the cancer, including in the liver.
Second-line chemotherapy and Bevacizumab were started in April 2024. So far, she has completed 5 cycles (4 cycles of Bevacizumab).
However, she has experienced high blood pressure and severe headaches.
Is there anyone with similar experiences?

ovarian,Question,Cheesecake92,Ultrasound Results,"
Hi all, I’m looking for some advice if anyone has been in a similar situation. This could cover cervical and ovarian cancers. 
In 2023 I had an abnormal smear which turned out to be CIN1, I was advised a follow up in a year. 
Since August 2024 I started to get symptoms (abnormal bleeding and after intercourse, always bloated, lower back and pelvic pain) - went to the doctors in September and she sent me urgently to the gynaecologist. The doctor also found a lump on my lower right abdomen. 
They sent me to colposcopy - who found more abnormal cells. They took multiple biopsies and the doctor advised I would require some kind of treatment and she would like to keep me under her consulting… but to wait for the ultrasound. As a bit of background my mum has stage 4 cancer - cervical and womb after having a hysterectomy that unfortunately didn’t get it all. 
My ultrasound is next week and they’ve said to go straight to gynaecology afterwards. The consultant doctor called this morning and said “would I be considering any more children?” I asked if they had any results from my colonoscopy but she just explained they forgot to ask this, no confirmed results and we’re weighing up the options for possible treatments. I don’t want any more children. 
I’m so bad with uncertainty. I’m open to any treatment that needs doing, like many, I just don’t cope well with the wait. Do you think I should be taking someone with me next week to gynaecology after my ultrasound? Will they be able to tell me anything at my ultrasound appointment? I was under the impression I’d just be in and out of ultrasound and await my results. 
Sorry for the long post and thank you.

ovarian,Question,Georgia H,24 years. Granulosar cell tumour treatment,"
Hi everyone,
I am 24 years old and had a 19cm ovarian cyst on my left ovary which has a suspicious looking mural nodule. I had the cyst and mural nodule removed via minilaparotomy about 6/7 weeks ago now and just had my biopsy results back after multiple rounds of re testing to confirm exactly what it was. 
It has been confirmed to be a sex cord granulosar cell tumour, stage 1 low malignancy. Due to my age and the fact I am yet to have children I have been given the option of ‘watch and wait’, having ultrasounds every 3 months to monitor the affected ovary for any reoccurrence. I can also have the affect ovary removed via key hole surgery and further monitoring and a biopsy following this, which I have been told can give peace of mind and reduce the recurrence risk. I only found out yesterday so am taking some time to process and make a decision but was wondering if anyone here has had a similar experience or any particular route they would recommend.
I am reluctant to have the affected left ovary removed as my right ovary is ppolycystic in appearance and i have some fertility concerns especially due to the fact the granulosar cell tumour means I cannot receive any fertility treatment in the future. My partner and family and friends have obviously said the decision is my own and whatever I decide will be the right decision, but they are more inclined to say surgery sooner rather than later would perhaps be the best option. 
Any comments or advice much appreciated 
THank you,

Hi everyone,
I have just joined the forum today so relatively new to all this!
After having bloating, back pain, pelvic pain and now sciatica I paid to have an ultrasound during the week. Im 45 years old.
They described a well defined area on my right ovary with echoes? 1.9 x 2.0 x 1.3  query haemmorraghic cyst or endometrioma the report says.
I have to go back in 6 weeks for a repeat scan and to check the right ovary however was told to ring my gp asap for a gynae referral.  I can't get in to see gp until 1st November.
Ive been trying not to get too stressed, but it difficult as I'm sure you all understand.  Just wanting to know if anyone has been in the situation or is in this situation and what the next steps are likely to be?
Thanks for taking the time to read this and wishing you all a lovely relaxed Sunday.

if anyone is having this drug every 3 weeks could you tell me please your experience of side effects? I started 1st dose. It was added to my chemio n.6 and it will be added to chemio n.7 , my last. Then I will have to continue just with it for several sessions every 3 weeks.

ovarian,Question,Rawdoodles,Urgent referral for ovarian cyst,"
I’m not sure where to began. I feel completely lost like time has just stopped. Maybe I’m jumping ahead of myself but I really am fearing the worst.
about 4 weeks ago I had my smear test and that same evening I started experiencing severe pelvic pain, fever, chills. Called 111 as it was Friday evening and they prescribed antibiotics for a suspected water infection. The pain eased with painkillers but the next day still felt unwell, had cold sweats and passed out. Stupidly I did not go to hospital and started taking the antibiotics. These did not work so spent the next week at my doctors, a different antibiotic which also didn’t work, still having pelvic pain at the front but now started to have twinges on the left side (felt different to the pelvic pain I was already having) my dr referred me for an ultrasound and gave me different antibiotics a combination of 2 they use to treat pelvic inflammatory disease. These antibiotics have cleared up any infection that may have been in my pelvis and the pelvic pain has gone I’m feeling much better. Still having these twinges though in my left ovary. Went for my scan and she found a 2.5cm “cyst” on my left ovary. She didn’t seem concerned and she let me see the screen, didn’t know what I was looking at though. She also said there was fluid in there which I thought was a good thing and she didn’t seem worried.

i went to see my doctor today who had the report back and he mentioned “vascular” which didn’t sound good. He referred me on the 2 week wait he said he didn’t think it was cancer but this will get me seen quickly. Now I’m panicking and I googled what vascular means when it comes to cysts and it said they’re linked to cancer. I’m so confused because when she did the scan she mentioned there was fluid in there. 
sorry to ramble. Has anyone else had this before and it turned out to be a cyst? It seems small but I’m sure size does not factor into cancer. I’m just terrified it is cancer and who knows how long Iv had this. 
thanks

ovarian,Question,BoopTheSnoot,Considering Refusing Chemo,"
I was diagnosed with Clear Cell Carcinoma in August following surgery to remove a cyst from an ovary. At the beginning of September I had a complete hysterectomy, oophorectomy, omentectomy, and removal of my peritoneum. 
I’m really struggling with my mental health at the moment. The worst aspect of all of this is that I’ve had to cancel plans and I’m missing out on so much. My life is becoming a series of four walls and I can’t cope with that, having had a similar experience last year that made me suicidal. I’m considering refusing the chemo so I can at least live my life, no matter how short it may be.

Has anyone else been in a similar position?

ovarian,Question,26Girlie,BEP chemo for ovarian cancer,"
Hi all,

I am struggling so much with the symptoms of chemotherapy from BEP chemo 5 days in patient with Eptopside, Cisplatin for 5 days straight then going between the rounds of 21 days having biomicine. I am currently on round 2 but have another 2 to go.. and honestly I’m not sure it’s worth finishing is how I feel. even though the effectiveness of this chemo is very good. 
my tumours are 16cm-12cm and the other smaller 8cm-6cm. They did offer for me to have them removed first but I would lose my fertility completely and I’m only 26. It just feels like I can’t get through this chemo mentally, the exhaustion.. the constant Acid, feeling of nausea and because my tumours are so big pressing on my bowel.. constipation and diarrhoea going between the 2. Also the steroids keep me up.. so I have only been getting 2 hours a night after chemo and I did take a sleeping tablet last night so I do feel better rested but I woke up with diarrhoea intermittently. 
they plan on 4 rounds but currently I feel like I can only manage 3.. and questionable. And it’s so hard to keep with it when at the end I may have to have the 2 ovaries removed anyway. But hopefully one shrinks enough to save it. 
I feel like asking my oncologist if I can see if one tumour the smaller one has shrunk enough after 2 rounds so I can just have the left one removed. Then I feel the chemo would be easier with not as much bloating and bulk on me. 
even if I have surgery I will have to have chemo after I just think the main big tumour being removed would help me out with managing chemo symptoms. 
I have a germ cell tumour which I appreciate is rare, so there might not be that many people out there with a relatable experience. 
also whilst this is going on, my mum is also going through cancer so we are doing this together.

ovarian,Question,Cheekkat,Not happy with my consultants decisions.   Can I get a second opinion?,"
Today I had a colonoscopy and a gastroscopy and a cervical smear. 
Started off under Colorectal Consultant and after a clear colonoscopy and gastroscopy with NED, one of the consultants came to see me and said next thing is PET scan and then debulking surgery with removal of omentum then chemo.
Was so happy !
Then was told the Gynae consultant wants to see me and do a little examination too,  and also a cervical smear. 
In the chat afterwards he said he now believes I have small bowel cancer!  because the histopathology last week says  mucinous adenocarcinoma of possible GI origin, and he thinks thats correct and clearly is the right  diagnosis.  If so why waste time with colonoscopy and gastroscopy ! This despite the fact that the CT scan is highly suggestive of a Gynae origin, either primary peritoneal,  tubal or ovarian and colonoscopy and gastroscopy ( where no biopsies taken)  refute Colorectal! 
A friend who just happens to be a Consultant Radiologist in Wales, and who has looked at all my scans and histology report and who said there is no cancer in my small bowel  and it's totally normal.
She says I need to get a second opinion and new Gynae Consultant.
The Gynae Consultant  refused PET scan and debulking and says we have to wait 2 more weeks for further tests to come back to prove it is GI mucinous adenocarcinoma. He says no point in PET scan because I have extensive mets in abdomen, and that is not even true.. I have maximum of 4 mets in omentum. He then admitted he knew nothing about HIPEC, either. 
I am not happy with his opinion and wish to seek advice from a different Consultant,  the one I have in mind is the lovely lady who I first saw in Gynae. Can I just request her for a second opinion?
Or change to her. 
I don't think the current Gynae Consultant  is any good for me he appears to want to dump me on the Colorectal team  
It was his idea to order colonoscopy and gastroscopy to prove the cancer is GI,  now it's visibly not  GI he seems to be fixated on it being  from a different part of the GI tract.
Small bowel cancer is a very rare cancer! 
Also a PET scan would show if cancer in small intestine.
Mucinous adenocarcinoma  can also come from fallopian tube, ovary and primary peritoneal cancer  I am told. It's not confined to just GI tract.

When scanning my thigh (which found a soft tissue mass throughout my leg so also dealing with that) they found a defined mass in left ovary.

ovarian,Question,Glass Not Full,Biopsy for ovarian tumour,"

Ive been reading online that biopsies tend not to be done because of the risk of any cells spilling etc. However it was unclear prior to surgery where the origin was as it was in the retro peritoneum - they weren’t sure if it was gynaecological or a sarcoma. 
Presumably if it had been decided sooner that it was ovarian, then there would not have been a biopsy.

ovarian,Question,Cheekkat,Had my CT scan today,"
I had my CT scan today and was told I would be contacted by Consultant either today or Monday  (so same day or next working day)   after they have made a diagnosis.
My lump was projecting upwards like an alien when I put my hands behind my head to go through the scanner,  it even feels like it's moving about !  Horrific !
I am concerned that the consultant thinks this is urgent enough to get a diagnosis and results to me so fast.
Is this a standard time frame?
Certainly it is alarming to me.

ovarian,Question,Foxgloverose,Niraparib causing emotional problems,"
Hi, I started on 200 mg Niraparib 2 weeks ago after 6 rounds of chemo for stage 4 ovarian cancer. 
After 10 days on the Niraparib, I started to feel very anxious, jumpy and tense. It's hard to explain - a bit like you've had 10 coffees, or waiting to go into the dentist for root canal surgery with no anaesthetic -that kind of stressed up feeling. I can also feel my heart jumping in my chest. It's getting worse every day and I can't really cope with feeling like this. 
I read in the Niraparib advice sheet on here that it can cause emotional problems, which I suppose is what's happening.  I really don't want to stop the Niraparib as I've been told my cancer will return, but at least the Niraparib may slow it down. I feel caught between a rock and a hard place .....
Does anyone have any advice? Or experienced the same thing?

ovarian,Question,Charbecca,Ovarian cancer stage 4b,"
Hi, my first post on this forum.  I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer stage 4b in January 2024 which has also spread lymph nodes under my and neck. I have been having chemotherapy every week carboplatin and paclitaxel. unfortunately I have had the last 3 out of 4 weeks of chemotherapy cancelled due to low immune system caused by the chemo. My concern is having so many cancelled how does this affect the treatment as it seems the less chemo I receive the less the treatment will work. I asked the senior sister of the chemo unit this question and she couldn’t really answer it. So I’m now struggling mentally as I haven’t had the opportunity to speak to my oncologist so don’t know if there is a Plan B as my system seems to be reacting badly to the chemo. Has anybody else had this problem?

Grateful for any thoughts anyone might have? GP wants to check my CA125 next week. I am generally slim, but have quite a jelly belly (look at least 5 months pregnant). Am I right in thinking I am at very low risk of ovarian cancer and that obscured ovary is likely nothing to worry about?

ovarian,Question,Helena27,Facing chemo hairloss,"
Hi All.
I'm delighted that my surgeries have been successful. I am now preparing for the next step, the chemo. I see the oncologist on Fri 8th to start the ball rolling. My question isn't so much about dealing with side effects of the treatment, more abouty upcoming hairloss. 
Am I being ridiculous to think that it must be within the realms of possibility, for my own longish hair to be cut and, perhaps by a wigmaker or a competent seamstress, to be seen onto some type of stretchy band? I'm thinking that if I could wear that round my head, under a hat, I'd still have my hair framing my face when I go out. I wear hats, summer and winter a lot anyway. Surely this is achievable and not too costly. It seems like quite a simple process to me 
Anyone done it, tried it, know anyone who has? Anyone got thoughts, ideas, suggestions?

I’ve never had high blood pressure before - always upper end of normal.  During surgery and first chemo BP was OK if elevated due to the situation.
Had a PIIc fitted prior to second infusion which had to be adjusted a few days later as it was too far in by heart and causing issues.  Then I developed a chronic headache that paracetamol didn’t help.  Occurred to me to check my BP and it was much higher (like 30 basis points) averaging 150/105. 
Spoke to chemo doctor who referred me to GP.  Now monitoring 3 x daily and recoding for review with GO Tuesday.  Not dropping back down so I expect to start medication.

ovarian,Question,Becliz,Telephone call,"
It's been 3 weeks today that I had my C125 and transvaginal ultrasound. I hadn't received the results so rang the consultants secretary. She said that they hadn't received the results of the ultrasound yet (although I thought I knew them because the consultant informed me at the time that I had an enlarged ovary - post menopause) and although she did have the results of the C125 blood test she was unable to give me them over the phone. She said that they were just numbers to her so it wouldn't be a good idea to give them out on the phone. She said she would check the amount of time I would have to wait for the results to be sent to my GP. She was very kind and helpful but I am now wondering if the results look bad and she just didn't want to say over the phone. She must have some idea of what bad numbers look like? I understand that it's not advised to give test results over the phone and the possible ramifications of doing so, but I wondered if anyone has experience of this and can shed some light? Thank you :)

ovarian,Question,Glass Not Full,Reopen scar or new incision?,"
After my ovarian cancer surgery, with a large midline scar, my gynaecologist now wants to take me back to theatre to check for any further spread and to help stage the cancer as he didn’t do the original surgery. Although a small patch of wall of the distal ileum was removed as the tumour capsule was firmly adherent to it. Whilst the surgeon said it was very minimal and remover only so that the tumour could be removed intact without having to cut into it etc, I have been advised by some nurses that this would mean it’s not stage 1 as, however minimal, it can’t be said that the tumour was confined to just the ovary etc. 
My CNS has said that I will be asked on the morning of the surgery when he sees me, if I would prefer the surgeon to reopen the original scar or to make a separate incision.
Are there any benefits or greater risks for either option? I know that I already have a lot of adhesions. I’m therefore wondering if it’s perhaps best to leave the one scar to continue to heal and ask for a new incision if possible?If it helps, it will be 14 weeks from the original surgery.

ovarian,Question,Trishh,Surgery stage 4 Ovarian,"
HI, my first post on here so I will try to be as factually correct as I can.
Was diagnosed with cancer whilst on holiday in Spain last October 2023 and air ambulances back to the UK, it was a horrific experience there and I honestly believed I would not survive the week.  The Drs and staff in the hospital had written me off and I was in a dark and desperate place before returning to the UK.
Once back in the UK they confirmed stage 4 advanced serous Ovarian cancer, sadly before getting unwell in spain with breathing difficulties, pleural effusion, I had no pain or symptoms. It was difficult to process and still is if I am honest.   I underwent 6 rounds of weekly chemo, 2 drugs one week and single ones the other two. Even after the first chemo I felt better.  I was lucky enough to get little side effects for which I am truly grateful.  
My oncologist consultant has been amazing and has been trying to push for surgery but the cancer is in part of my stomach.  I have today been to Portsmouth and seen a Surgeon to discuss what they can do for me apart from maintenance drugs going forward.  I have been advised they will use a camera to ensure they can capture all the cancer in my stomach and if they feel they can get it all will continue straight onto the de bulking surgery along with whatever needs to be done to give me a better chance of life, this may include a stoma which could be temporary or permanent.  I wonder if anyone else has had this and could offer me any words of wisdom?  My heart is saying go with the chance of surgery as if the camera shows they can get it all then I will have a better chance of life (they have warned it will probably come back at some point somewhere else so this isn’t a cure) but it will be more me living with cancer. It would be a lateral surgery. I am not sure if this is the right decision or whether maintenance drugs is the way forward.
I am a fit and healthy 68yr old (just) who has managed to swim every day throughout my chemo, am hoping this will help me.
I thank my lucky stars I get to wake up each morning, just would like to hear from anyone who has been in a similar position. Thank you

ovarian,Question,Glass Not Full,Understanding histopathology report,"
Hi,
I was wondering if anyone might be able to help me understand this histopathology report please?
One nurse told me that it suggests a high grade tumour (in line with the biopsy result) and especially because it grew 8cm in 12 weeks, whilst another CNS says it's a grade 1 tumour. I am trying to get an appointment with my gynae-oncologist but he is currently away so any advice I can get in the meantime, would be much appreciated.
""Large smooth surfaced lobulated tumour....no evidence of exposure at receipt....multicystic neoplasm with cavities of varied sizes filled with mucin or blood; no definite tumour necrosis is identified. Sections show ovary with extensive infiltration.... Tumour cells are of a large size; they contain irregular nuclei with prominent nucleoli and moderately abundant cytoplasm; they form glands, cribriform nests or tubes. No Necrosis is identified. No squamous differentiation is noted. Tumour cells are positive with cytokeratin 7 and ER markers. There are also quite numerous clusters of Lydia cells which are faintly stained by inhibit marker. They could represent reactive hyperplasia; however an associated component of sex cord tumour remains a possibility.""

ovarian,Question,Glass Not Full,Menstrual Cycle,"
I was diagnosed with endometrioid ovarian adenocarcinoma and had a 15cm tumour removed in February.
I was diagnosed in November - I hadn’t had a proper period then, or a period at all in December. It returned to normal in January but had a very light one in Feb, last month and now this month.
The surgeon says all the tumour was removed - and it was just the tumour and one ovary (it wasn’t identified so they presume the tumour must have engulfed it). CA125 is back to a normal level.
The cancer is currently unstaged as the oncologist wants to take me back to theatre to check for any signs of spread (the surgeon says there were no visible signs in Feb) and take biopsies and tissue samples etc if necessary.
Just wondering if there is a connection between the periods and the cancer?
My CNS says it’s probably stress related and she may be right although the first light period was in November before I knew there was anything wrong…

Major weight loss, extreme exhaustion, no appetite, bloating, pelvic pain, bad pain in my leg with tingling and numbness etc. I was sent for a scan and I have been told I have a 6cm thick walled cyst with septations and low level echoes.

ovarian,Question,Glass Not Full,Picc line - what for?,"
Random question, but has anyone had a picc line inserted ahead of surgery?
I randomly got an appointment for a picc line insertion - I’ve questioned what it’s for and the nurses can only assume it’s for a potential staging surgery. The consultant’s secretary didn’t know about it.
One of the chemo nurses who was asked to change my dressing after it was inserted said she’s not known one to be used for surgery even if the veins are bad - and certainly not done prior to admission.
I did go for pre-op and they couldn’t get any blood as the one good vein was still bruised from a previous test but the nurse said that a dr or anaesthetist would probably try and insert a cannula on the ward and take blood then as they would also have an ultrasound scanner available too (I did mention to her that I had had a picc line put in after my last surgery when they couldn’t get a cannula in after removing them).
so I’m just intrigued if others with bad veins have had a picc line inserted prior to any surgery (which I also don’t have a date for yet).

Hi,
According to my surgeon there was excision of a  large ovarian tumour “with a small patch of wall of the distal ileum (firmly adherent to tumour capsule)”My surgeon, who isn’t a gynaecologist or gynaeoncologist, says stage 1 is when the tumour is confined to just the ovary.As a small patch of the wall was also removed (and apparently it was just a very tiny amount), would that generally classify as the tumour not being confined to just the ovary? Or for it to be considered to have spread beyond the ovary, does the tumour have to grown and spread right into another organ/tissue etc?

ovarian,Question,Tobes,Waiting for hysteroscopy,"
Hi,
My GP referred me (54) this week for an urgent hysteroscopy following post menopausal bleeding. In the last few weeks, I have had low level cramps - like a period is about to start all the time. I’ve also felt fatigued for months. My mother had uterine cancer in her 70s and survived but we haven’t been in contact for many years.
I’ve asked for a general anaesthetic because of previous problems cracking through my cervix, so although I’m anxious, I’m getting my head around the procedure. 
My main concern is my children (25F and 22M). My daughter doesn’t live at home but is struggling with life at the moment.. My son does live at home and has just started his career and is loving life. I am single.
I’d like to know when/how people have broached their possible health problems. Do you ride out the tests alone, hoping it’s nothing serious or do you brace the kids for bad news? Feeling a bit lost tbh.

My ovarian cancer is currently unstaged but I’m thinking it’s been caught really early and I’m one of the lucky ones?

Although it wasn’t a gynaecologist who performed the surgery so perhaps he wouldn’t know if it was in the uterus? As such chemo may be an option or there is a discussion about taking me back to theatre to have a look at the uterus and abdomen again with the gynaeoncologist.
But I’m thinking, if the bloods have returned to normal levels, is this not an indication that there isn’t any more cancer and that it was likely stage 1?

Just looking for advice and experience please.
Prior to surgery 7 weeks ago, my CA125 level was 256, up from Nov when it was first tested and 122.
Now the mass has been removed, should the levels have dropped and be back to normal if all the cancer has been removed?
or is it still too soon for the levels to have dropped?
if they haven’t dropped, is it because it’s too soon after surgery or because there is likely still some cancer?

ovarian,Question,Glass Not Full,Low grade but rapidly enlarging mass,"
So, histology found my endometrioid ovarian adenocarcinoma to be low grade - despite the original biopsy stating high grade.
The surgeon has now written on the letter to the gynaeoncologist that the surgery was had been urgent due to a “rapidly enlarging mass”…
I’m confused - to me this seems contradictory? Low grade on Google suggests slow growing but the surgeon says it was growing rapidly - which does actually fit in line more with the findings of the biopsy.
I did ask my gynaeoncologist about this but they just dismissed it.
But now I’m concerned that this may impact what the proposed treatment options may be.
The situation is already complicated by the fact that it wasn’t a gynaeoncologist who removed the 15x15cm mass.

Any advice or thoughts would be appreciated. Thank you.

ovarian,Question,Pinnig,Post Hysterectomy and BSO,"
I feel a bit of a fraud posting here as I dont know if I have cancer until the histology has been reported.
In late 2023 I had some telltale signs that something wasn't right. My GP picked it up right away and did a CA125 and sent me for ultrasound scans. The blood test was in normal range (phew) but the scan showed a solid vascular cyst. No idea of size or any more detail but I had an urgent referral to a gynaecologist. She said we won't know what it is until ""we've got it in a jar"" and recommended an urgent hysterectomy and BSO.
Yesterday I went in for the operation. They use robotic surgery as far as possible. I woke up with 4 nicks covered in plasters, fair bit of pain and discomfort. 
I didn't see the gynaecology surgeon before or after and was sent home 7 hours after I arrived. I'm type one diabetic and the nursing staff hadn't a clue how to manage by blood sugars.  
Can anyone offer their experience of what's next? I don't know how the surgery went and simply told I'll get a letter with the lab results. No follow up appointment.
In an immediate sense I dont know when I can shower, remove the dressings no whether I have stitches that need removing. I've no advice about getting up and moving around and building up some time exercise. I've no advice about HRT either.
My plan is to call my GP on Monday but I'm at home fretting so wondered if anyone could share what happened to them?

ovarian,Question,Glass Not Full,Treatment after surgery??,"
Hi,
I had a 15x15cm malignant mass removed on 8th Feb. The origin is not entirely clear as the biopsy was inconclusive however CA125 was 256 and CA19-908 prior to surgery.The sarcoma and gynae team were discussing my case and gynae were asked if chemo would be started prior to surgery but the decision was made that the tumour needed to come out.
They did advise after the surgery that they were unable to locate the right ovary and referred to it as “neoplasm of the right ovary” on the discharge letter.
So can I ask, knowing the above, is it likely that I will need further treatment following the surgery?Presumably it is likely to be chemo?
If so, how soon am I likely to commence this treatment? What is the average wait time or is there a certain timeframe within with I can expect to commence?

ovarian,Question,Romancereader17,No diagnosis - symptom & advocation talk.,"
Hi
so I’m new here, I don’t have a diagnosis so I hope that it’s okay that I’m here and that I don’t offend anyone with asking for advice. 
I have concerns and fear that I could possibly have ovarian cancer. I want to preface this with the fact I do have bad health anxiety. I have paternal family history of cancer. My grandad died from bowel cancer before I was born, my dad passed away from lung cancer and my uncle is currently battling prostate cancer. I didn’t used to have health anxiety but since March 2023 there has been health issue after health issue. And I just feel, hand on heart that something isnt right with my health. 
I have been going to the doctors with bladder issues since last year and haven’t gotten anywhere really, I struggle with urgency and frequency with me waking in the night multiple times, I’ve had a few UTI’s, I did have a bladder ultrasound which noted small bladder capacity. I have been to my doctors a few times because of going between constipation and diarrhoea and recently I’ve have some bleeding. A FIT test last week ruled out bowel cancer. 
what actually prompted me to go to the doctor last week wasn’t any fear of ovarian cancer because I didn’t have the knowledge of it then, but it was persistent heartburn and bloating, I was fed up of going through 3 packets of gaviscon a week and was hoping for Omeprazole. I’ve had some routine bloods done on Tuesday this week and my doctor asked for my CA-125 levels to be checked. As you can imagine I was right onto Google and was shocked at home many issues or symptoms I’ve been having that seem to match Ovarian cancer. *edit to add I have noticed and my partner has noticed the past couple of months my appetite has reduced with me feeling full/sick. Despite this I’ve still gained weight.
I was hoping for my results to be back by the weekend so I could stop the sheer anxiety and depression I’ve seemed to have found myself in. 
im not sure if I’m searching for advice/comfort or validation in my fears. 
I would love to hear any similar stories though, please.

sorry this is so long, thank you for reading.

ovarian,Question,Micas95,CT scan and bloods then an ultrasound,"
Hi, I'm writing on behalf of my mum who has just turned 50. In the last few weeks mum has suffered with constant bloating and early satiety and her GP felt a palpable mass in the abdomen which was confirmed by a gynaecologist last Tuesday. 
Last Thursday, mum had bloods taken (CEA, CA-125 and CA19-9) and a CT scan with contrast. This Tuesday, she was asked to come in for a pelvic ultrasound. No biopsy was taken and it was not a transvaginal one. We don't have the results from the bloods or CT scan yet as it has only been a week. 
I am a little confused why mum would have an ultrasound after a CT scan? From my online reading it seems to be an ultrasound is done first and then a CT scan if there are further concerns. I cannot comprehend why it has been done this way around and its sending my anxiety through the roof. 
I was wondering if anyone has had a similar experience in that they had a CT scan followed by an ultrasound and what this meant for them? Also if anyone knows what an ultrasound could show that a CT can't it would be very much appreciated if you could provide me with some advice.

ovarian,Question,OL3005,Suspicious large Cyst and diagnosis of Endometriosis,"
Hi, I feel a bit of fraud posting here as I’m kind of in limbo at the moment.
Back in October I experienced some watery/pink discharge and slight cramping. I immediately took myself off to the doctors and was met by a rather unimpressed male doctor, who even asked me why I had come when it only happened once. I explained my periods had been some what heavier and painful of late but that I was regular as clock work and had not experienced anything like this before - I also wasn’t due on for another two weeks. . He swabbed my cervix and said if the results came back fine then to leave it and see if it happens again. Obviously they came back fine so i carried on as usual and thought maybe I was just becoming peri menopausal. Next month came and the discharge came again, this time for a week. I took myself back to the doctors and was told to have some blood tests and was booked in for an ultrasound.. My CA125 came back at 70 but it was done during my period so I had to re take it and then it was 58. I went for my scan and they found thickening of the womb, polyps and a 8x5cm complex borderline cyst with fluid and solid parts on my right ovary. Referred to hospital to confirm what was seen on the scan and have an endometrium biopsy and MRI. After the MDT, the biopsy for my womb has come back clear and I have been diagnosed with endometriosis - this is what has caused the cyst. I’m now so confused which is the best decision for me in regards to treatment, I’ve been offered removal of the ovary and polyps or a complete abdominal hysterectomy. I’m 36 and I know they would like me to keep an ovary due to having a family but I have a 17yr old son and 10yr old daughter … my family is already complete. I feel due to the cyst ( which I won’t find out is cancerous until after the op) the endometriosis and the polyps that I should go for the hysterectomy. I would never forgive myself if I didn’t do everything possible to have as much time with my children as possible. I would feel awful if I find out it’s cancer and chose to only have one ovary taken. Then again, am I putting myself through major surgery when I could just opt for the ovary removal which could be benign or pre cancerous? I know how difficult menopause will be - I’ve done the research. But it can’t be as difficult as the last two monthes have been worrying about not being with my children. I don’t even know what advice I’m asking for? Has anyone been in this predicament. I’m on the cancer route, have met my macmillan nurse and being treated by cancer surgeons but haven’t been diagnosed? I have my pre op tomorrw - So my op is in the next few weeks.

Hi, I feel a bit of fraud posting here as I’m kind of in limbo at the moment.
Back in October I experienced some watery/pink discharge and slight cramping. I immediately took myself off to the doctors and was met by a rather unimpressed male doctor, who even asked me why I had come when it only happened once. I explained my periods had been some what heavier and painful of late but that I was regular as clock work and had not experienced anything like this before - I also wasn’t due on for another two weeks. . He swabbed my cervix and said if the results came back fine then to leave it and see if it happens again. Obviously they came back fine so i carried on as usual and thought maybe I was just becoming peri menopausal. Next month came and the discharge came again, this time for a week. I took myself back to the doctors and was told to have some blood tests and was booked in for an ultrasound.. My CA125 came back at 70 but it was done during my period so I had to re take it and then it was 58.

Recent scan showed cancer grown and spread and mum has now made the decision to stop all treatment.
The oncologist has said that we are looking at 'long weeks short months' and I know everyone is different, but could someone please let me know roughly what that means? We are trying to plan things with mum for the time she has left but I also want to know roughly what we are looking at so we can prepare.

ovarian,Question,Sadiex89,Germ Cell Immature Teratoma Treatment,"
Hi everyone,
5 weeks ago I had a 19cm tumour removed from my ovary along with both ovaries and tubes, my AFP markers were 3349 and the tumour had a bleed inside, causing it to increase in size so quickly.
I've since been told I had a grade 1a germ cell immature teratoma. 
I have been told I will now need a full hysterectomy, and a decision will be made by oncology and the germ cell mdt as to whether I will need chemotherapy.
I realise this type of cancer is rare, but just wanted to know whether chemotherapy will be likely? There's mixed information online and I am worried whilst waiting for news.

ovarian,Question,Boo13,Awaiting Tests / Diagnosis,"
Hello all,
I’m new here and have been reading all your stories / advice and wanted to share my story thus far and if anyone has experienced anything similar?
I turned 40 this year and before my birthday came I decided to live more healthily and started a diet and joined the gym.  I had been losing weight through diet and once I lost approx 2 / 2.5 stone I noticed my abdomen looked quite swollen in comparison to my frame.  I thought I would go to the doctors to see if there was anything untoward, as my mom had a history of digestive issues.  The doctor thought an ovary could be swollen and referred me to a 2 weeks appt and blood tests.  I only have occasional abdominal discomfort and no other symptoms. Periods are normal and regular.
All bloods came back normal except CA125 - this is at 224.  I’ve had an ultrasound which has found some fluid and 4 large masses around my abdomen, potentially one linked to an ovary and another to my uterus.  The sonographer couldn’t see where the other 2 may be originating but they are quite spread.
I’ve been for a CT scan and currently waiting for results / next steps.  Could be another 2 weeks or so.  Doctors have suggested it might be cancer, although I have no history of cancer in my family so this came as a bit of a shock.   Has anyone had similar or know of any other benign conditions that could cause this.  The waiting for information is horrible and I know it can’t be diagnosed from a CT scan either so not sure how they test the masses and how long this will take.

ovarian,Question,Boo13,Awaiting Tests / Diagnosis,"
Hello all,
I’m new here and have been reading all your stories / advice and wanted to share my story thus far and if anyone has experienced anything similar?
I turned 40 this year and before my birthday came I decided to live more healthily and started a diet and joined the gym.  I had been losing weight through diet and once I lost approx 2 / 2.5 stone I noticed my abdomen looked quite swollen in comparison to my frame.  I thought I would go to the doctors to see if there was anything untoward, as my mom had a history of digestive issues.  The doctor thought an ovary could be swollen and referred me to a 2 weeks appt and blood tests.  I only have occasional abdominal discomfort and no other symptoms. Periods are normal and regular.
All bloods came back normal except CA125 - this is at 224.  I’ve had an ultrasound which has found some fluid and 4 large masses around my abdomen, potentially one linked to an ovary and another to my uterus.  The sonographer couldn’t see where the other 2 may be originating but they are quite spread.

ovarian,Question,treebee,Awaiting results and further tests,"
Hi folks.
I went to my GP on Monday for bleeding between periods (and other symptoms that I thought were pretty non-specific). I wasn't worried about it until my doctor said my symptoms could be caused by ovarian or cervical cancer and promptly referred me for a transvaginal ultrasound and a blood test. I had the bloods done yesterday and it's hit me now that it could be cancer and my anxiety has just gone completely FERAL. I've not told my family or friends because I don't want to worry anyone - it could turn out to be nothing.
How do I cope with the anxiety while I'm waiting for the blood test results and imaging? I literally can't stop worrying and it's at the point I'm feeling nauseous constantly.
thank you x

I went for a pelvic ultrasound last month and the results came back saying there was a poorly defined heterogenous area on my right ovary and a gynae opinion was recommended,(i only know this was said from my nhs app) my GP contacted me the following day by text and said i would be referred to gynae and i'd need a blood test, i went for the blood test and i asked the nurse what it was for which she replied just hormones... so i went for my gynae appointment last week and it was awful the gynaecologist asked me why i'd been referred as he didnt have any notes when i explained what i knew (which was very little) he then said oh its just a cyst your tumour markers have come back ok! ( this is the blood test i thought was for hormones!! but ill give you a exam..the exam lasted 2 mins he was rough and it hurt he then said i'll put you on the pill and get another us in 6 weeks and see him again in 6 months, i felt he was very didmissive and didn't feel like i had a right to be there. i have since recieved the notes he sends to the GP which say i told him i had a 18mm folicle/cyst and on examination my stomach wasn't tender! he didnt even touch my stomach, its all very odd and just want some imput as to what others think about this,sorry to go on  TIA

ovarian,Question,Jholly,Abnormal liver function,"
Hi all, did any of you have abnormal liver function which was just related to the stress of the surgery. I am 12 weeks post debulking for mucinous ovary stage 1C3  and tumor markers currently normal which I am pleased with. I have not had chemo. my liver function was noted to be abnormal a month after surgery and remains abnormal. Hoping it could it just be stress from the illness.

Hello
Iwas diagnosed with Ovarian cancer stage 4a in August 2021. Also am BRIP1. I Have had debulking surgery and 8 rounds of  chemotherapy and in July 2022 until today was on Niraparib. Today I was told my CT scan in early  June 2023 shows a dark spot on my liver and a smaller dark spot on my spleen. Both have appeared since a CT scan in late March 2023. It’s also on my peritoneum but i knew that from day one. I start 6 sessions chemotherapy again in two weeks.
Stupidly I forgot to ask about the possibility of more surgery. Is this at likely? Or will it just be the chemotherapy? Any advice would be gratefully received thankyou so much

ovarian,Question,Tina23,Kidney damage from chemo.,"
I'm feeling a little overwhelmed and struggling to take in the information following my appointment with my consultant yesterday. I've been on carbo and taxel, I'm supposed to have 6 rounds 3 weeks apart. I've been suffering really bad side effects which have got worse with each round. I made it to 3 rounds but then got really ill, I was admitted to hospital with febrile neutrapenia then after I was discharged my pre chemo blood test showed I was anaemic  low platelets and my liver and kidneys not coping and im too ill to have chemo. I had a blood transfusion, which made me feel so much better, and an ultrasound on my liver and kidneys. Yesterday I saw my consultant who told me my liver has recovered but my kidneys are scarred and thin. My kidney function was fine before chemo so it's the chemo that's damaged them. She said it is a rare side effect and I'm pretty unlucky to get it. She's referring me to renal consultant, giving me another 2 weeks off to recover more and then if pre chemo bloods show levels improved or at least stable, I'm just going to have carboplatin for a round and see how that goes. My questions for you lovely lot are who has had carboplatin on its own and what side effects did you get? I'm hoping I'll be less ill with this? Also I'm a bit confused as I've read that it's the carboplatin that is most likely to have caused the kidney damage so unsure why we are continuing with that? I know paclitaxel is the most toxic of the 2. Its all just going around in my head. My kidney function us not critical currently but any more damage and it could be.  Just looking for advice really.

And has anyone had a similar experience where they didn’t really know what the surgery would be until it was over? 
Thanks so much,

ovarian,Question,Lizzieinapickle,Mature 7.5cm cystic teratoma of left ovary ca125 FINE  - ca19.9 568 .. not fine,"
Hi
I don't know who's around but i desperately need to talk ..
I'm in good health and no symptoms at all ... random ultrasound found an ovarian cyst that looked very much benign in shape etc
I've seen the gyne and she wanted it out but initially no rush.
Then i had blood tests and that marker was silly high ... she rang me up and said not to think of the worst but didn't give me anything else to think about as an alternative. What else is it other than something awful?
I have an MRI on saturday (nhs.. saturday .. very urgent) 
Then wait for results - if the cyst appears the be the source ( please let it be the source!!!) then i comes out fairly fast. If the cyst looks ok on the MRI then we get more images from CT etc ..
I just know the changes here are pancreas/ lung / ovary and bowel ... or occasionally the cyst makes the markers and there is no cancer. 
I'm pretty much non stop crying - i have huge anxiety with people and place and the big girl pants are coming out to play atm.
Does anyone have the same ca issues as me?

ovarian,Question,Beclex,2ww referral. Confused as to why.,"
Went to my gp few weeks back with some ongoing acid reflux, bloating and weight loss (only 7 pounds ish). She requested bloods and a pelvic ultrasound to rule out a few things she said. So I had the bloods on the Tuesday, ultrasound in the Thursday. All very quick I was impressed. Person who did the ultrasound scan told me looks normal but couldn’t find right ovary, not uncommon in post menopause woman. Doctors rings and asks me to come in to discuss results. My ca125 was higher than it should be. Tells me I need to be seen by gynaecologist on the 2 week wait. Sends me a text link to cancer research uk explains what a 2 week wait was etc. 

now my confusion is that surely if my ultrasound was normal I should just of had these bloods repeated in days month?. I was a bit dumb struck at the appointment and wish I’d asked.

ovarian,Question,CharlotteE,No treatment option,"
Hello I’m new here and after reading a lot of the threads I thought I would reach out. 
My gorgeous Nanny has been diagnosed with ovarian cancer and has ca125 markers which are approx 250 and a tumour which is approx 20cm and confirmed spread to other areas in the pelvis. 
Nanny is not a well enough to undergo surgery or treatment, and with her also having worsening Alzheimer’s, hospital is not an option for her as she finds it extremely disorientating and it would be against her wishes.My mum is off working being her full time carer so she can stay in her own home which she has always said she wanted. 
I guess we’re in shock, she’s always been so fit and well and independent and watching her slowly deteriorate is breaking our hearts.

Has anyone else on this forum experienced someone choose a no treatment option and can share any bits of advice we would be so so grateful.

ovarian,Question,Meeshy,Mom diagnosed with stage 2a clear cell - feeling scared,"
Hi all, it has been a real whirlwind last few months. My mom went through a full hysterectomy for ovarian cancer and is recovering steadily. It has been difficult to function as we've waited for the staging and grading. I have read everything there is to read, I feel - I know that's not always helpful but I can't stop myself. I am an only child and my mom has had so many health issues in life, it's been really hard for me to cope. Her staging and grading appointment was today and I fully expected the result to be stage 3c of the most common type. She was diagnosed stage 2a with the clear cell type. I could tell my parents were immediately relieved it was a lower stage than we expected, but I followed up to ask for more information as I caught that it was clear cell, which is rarer. It is hard to find a lot of information about clear cell in particular and I am still just as scared as before. My mom's doctor discussed the survival stats with us and I know my parents interpreted it as my mom having 3 years to live, which is not the ""truth"". Overall I am feeling lost and scared. I read about so much in preparation but her having a rarer subtype that doesn't respond as well to chemo has me scared again. If anyone here also has been living with clear cell ovarian cancer, I am very interested in your experience. Thank you.

I was diagnosed with Stage 3 (C) Ovarian cancer on 11 Jan. Have had one cycle of chemo (14 Feb) with just Carboplatin and all went OK.

Then had 2nd chemo cycle this Tue (7 Mar). It was a bit of a disaster. They added Paclitaxel into the mix and I had a severe allergic reaction, nearly losing consciousness. They had to bring in two doctors (one from ICU) so they must have been pretty worried. Wondering what's next for me.

ovarian,Question,Bamboodle,Reoccurrence in liver,"
Hi all, first time posting here. So my 64 year old mum was diagnosed with stage 4 serous ovarian cancer 2 years ago, debunking surgery, and chemo. She was stable and doing really well. However unfortunately in November 2022 following a short period of being extremely unwell we found out that she has multiple spread to her liver. She was in a very unwell state with extreme pain (morphine 4 times daily), huge bloated abdomen and terrible pain. The consultant told us she was extremely worried about her.... we didn't think she would make it to Christmas. However, she was offered chemo (gemcarbo) as a ""its worth a shot"". Following only 1 dose of carboplatin the pain disappeared! She continued to our amazement to improve dramatically day by day. Following the ct scan half way through treatment the kargest tumour gas shrunk from 16cm to 7cm!! And all of then had significantly shrunk in size. It was the best news we could hear. She is now at the end of chemo and gas to gave a break. We will find out in 3 weeks if the chemo has continued working. Her ca marker went from 19 to 286 in a month so it was extremely quick and aggressive. My question is, I don't have a clear picture of what happened next. My mum doesn't want to know which makes it difficult for me to find out the information or ask the questions I want to ask. We are both fully aware that it is just a case of waiting and seeing until the tumours start to grow again. I guess I feel like I want to know if months is realistic rather than years. I know each case is individual and nobody knows the answers for sure, I just feel like as her carer I want to know what a realistic life span may now be.

ovarian,Question,Roxanne0103,Niraparib,"
Hi everyone,
Hats off to all the ladies here for going through this journey.
I really need some advice on this medication. I was diagnosed with Stage 3 high grade ovarian cancer in July last year. I had surgery first- full hysterectomy and removal of lymph nodes and small areas where it was visible. I had 5rounds of chemo -Docetaxel and carboplatin which finished in Dec.
Since I'm BRCA 1 positive, I'm now put on maintenance medication Niraparib 600mg per day-split in two doses of 300mg each. Its been a week now and I feel nauseous and tired most of the time. I'm planning to start work  in a month. I am concerned if I'll be able to do it all. My husband is also going out of the country for a work project for a few months. I have to manage myself and my 10yr old son who is preparing for his 11+exams.
Is there anyone out here without taking the medication and who have successfully kept the cancer at bay? I understand the medication only delays the recurrence.

ovarian,Question,CS1981,Feeling scared,"
Hi,
I've been having abnormal vaginal bleeding since June last year, GP sent me for a scan and bloods in August last year which showed a 5.7cm cyst on my Right ovary, 3.7cm on my left, and thickened endometrial lining. Referred me to Gynae urgently but because I live in Portugal that was 4 months till I was seen. Bleeding now pretty much back to normal flow tho still irregular (was regular before June last year), but at my Gynae appointment on Tuesday the consultant said there was no evidence of thickened endometrial lining, but ""both my ovaries were enlarged"". She didn't say cyst or what she thought it was, just that she wanted me to get bloods done, start the pill and go back in a month for another ultrasound. Felt ok about that until I looked up what the bloods were for, and all 6 blood tests are checking for ovarian cancer. Really scared now that that's what she thinks I've got as it's been 8 months since symptoms started and worried if it is ovarian it will have spread all over by now. I think what makes it worse is that my mum was only 4 years older than I am now when she was diagnosed with breast cancer and she died 8 years later from the disease. Has anyone else had something similar and all come back ok?

ovarian,Question,WonderK,Waiting diagnosis,"
So I never expected to be here at 31 years old. I’ve had acid reflex for years and I have multiple chronic illnesses including PCOS, asthma, EDS, IBS
My Dr has been putting off investigating my reflux for years and just keeps me on omeprozole but it’s becoming less effective. I starting looking online to see what to do but starting noticing that some of my symptoms were cropping up for bowel cancer, I dug a little deeper and discovered that actually not just the symptoms I was looking for but symptoms for my other illnesses were joined by one thing, ovarian cancer. Periods after menopause? Sign of OC. Asthma worsening? Sign of OC. BP all over the place? OC. Increase in testosterone. OC. Bloating, feeling full, loss of appetite. OC. Etc etc.
I started getting worried and tried to tell myself that Google had got in my head. So I booked an appointment at my GP and listed my symptoms but didn’t tell him what I thought. He came to a similar conclusion. He ran a bunch of blood tests but all came back fine.
Then I got a call from my Endocrinologist as I’m trying to get back on meds for my PCOS and I’d just had some bloods done for that. She wanted to do more tests, I told her about my GP and she said yes that’s one of the things it could be, alongside 2 other things. 
She ran more bloods but those came back normal. So now I’m booked in for a pelvic MRI and I’m really scared.
That’s two rounds of blood tests that failed to find something other than cancer. And now I’m off for an urgent MRI. Im scared and angry because I’ve felt unwell for a while but my GP didn’t take me seriously and I’m so Unwell as my day to day usual I put my symptoms down to my other conditions. Seeking medical help is exhausting because I’m never taken seriously. It took me over 5 years to get diagnosed with my fibromyalgia and I’ve had issues with reflux for 5 years now too and still can’t get help. 
Part of me feels like I’m just “being dramatic” and let Google worry me. But, the fact that two different Drs looking at two different things share a potential diagnosis is scary. And the more tests that don’t find something else, the closer we get to worst case scenario. And I’m filled with dread and anxiety and I keep trying to tel myself it’s okay to be scared but years of fighting to be heard and dismissed makes me feel like I’m being a hypochondriac and wasting the NHSs time and resources. Has anyone else felt like that?

ovarian,Question,Dolly21,Overian cancer stage 3,"
Hi I'm new to the group.
I was told I had overian cancer nearly two weeks ago.
I had a CT scan last Wednesday, and on the Friday of  last week I was told I had stage 3 cancer.
I still haven't been given a date for my hysterectomy yet and this is starting to make me panick.
I am feeling so low and negative, all I want to do is cry.
I can't believe this has happened as the doctors told me the cysts on my ovarys  were not  cancerous.
It was only that I said I wanted them removed as my stomach was so swollen and I had bladder leakage, that they found out it had started in my left fallopian tube and spread to the left and right ovarys.
I just a chat to ladies in a simular situation to me.

ovarian,Question,LozB87,Bowel blockage and kidney function advice,"
Hi all, I haven’t posted on here for some time. My mum had ovarian cancer stage 3 in 2021 then later diagnosed with a separate rare appendix cancer goblet cell that same year (following pathology results after her debulk surgery for ovarian). She is currently now stage 4 goblet cell and has never had specific treatment for it. 
Currently, after a couple of weeks of in / out at the Christie, another bowel blockage has finally been found. The only way to treat this is by her starting the chemo (capecitebine tablets initially then poss combined with ox p). The issue with this is the C is affecting her kidneys slightly, more so the right side. If her kidney function isn’t quite good enough at present then they want to do a Nephrostomy bag (I think that’s what they call them?) before chemo to get her function up. This we find out today.
Mum initially, and understandably, went into meltdown and said no, take her home. But of course if she does this then life won’t be of much quality and it’d likely be short. She’s 65, has very young grandchildren and a lot to live for. That said she’s battled both ovarian and appendix cancer for the last 20 months. Can I blame her for feeling like throwing the towel in.. no of course. But to me and the rest of the family, she still has options. Ones that MAY work and give her some more time. How much I’ve no idea. Maybe I’m being selfish but I of course want her to do what she needs to do. Any advice around the blockage, kidney function / bag and how you manage, or general would be very much appreciated xxxx

ovarian,Question,KirsteeH,Doubled in size,"
Hello!
Following an NHS scan on the 11th, I was told by my doctor I had a suspicious cyst and they were going to rescan in 8-10 weeks.
I had a private scan on Saturday 10 days later for reassurance and was told I have a septated cyst…. Also my endometrial lining is thicker than expected at 9mm. I had an app with my GP today as I am extremely bloated and constipated, I gave him my results from my private scan Saturday & he said my cyst has doubled in size in less that 2 weeks and is now over 5cm. (How can this double in that time?) they also said it’s not dermoid. It didn’t look very good on the screen however the private Sonographer said (which is very patronising) if you were my daughter I wouldn’t be losing sleep over this, as your very young and Ovarian cancer is so rare in people your age!
should I be worried? I’m not one to moan but something really does not seem right, I can just. I’m barely eating a thing and I’m constantly bloated. I just want someone to tell me I’m not over reacting! My GP said he was going to make an urgent referral but will send them a message so that they go directly to him and he will call me in a couple of days. Has anyone had this before that resulted in Ovarian Cancer?

ovarian,Question,percypig,Diagnosis,"
Hi.
I haven’t been diagnosed with Ovarian Cancer, but however am displaying a lot of symptoms. I don’t know who to turn to so I thought I would come here and see if maybe those who have been diagnosed have experienced the same things as myself. I have a very strong family history of cancer, and recently just lost my father to pancreatic cancer. I’ll list my symptoms down below:
Bleeding heavily and consistently since - 7th sept
Malaise
nausea (after eating)
Feeling full after eating - for example I just ate an egg and I feel extremely full up, I used to be able to eat like I was a bottomless pit
Fatigue
Right flank pain, lower back
Pelvic pain
Ovaries look slightly poly cystic
Burst ovarian cyst
Constipation
white blood cells in urine
Extreme bloating - even when not eating
I have been in and out of A&E and back and forth to the doctors and I keep being told I am fine and that I’m a young hormonal girl (I’m 18). I just feel like I’m being dismissed. I know there might be nothing wrong, but I feel dreadful every day and it’s just getting worse. I’ve had blood work done and they say that it is fine. I guess I just want to know if this has happened to anyone else in the community.

Hi, I'm having surgery next week to remove the left ovary with a 3cm mass and the right ovary has a suspect cyst so removal of both ovaries.
I had right side breast cancer, S3 G3, inflammatory HER2 in 2008, adjuvant chemo for 8cm mass, followed by mastectomy and radiotherapy in 2009. Herceptin for 18 months.
I then developed a low grade tumour in left breast, had radiotherapy and tamoxifen for 5 years.
Now this. 64 years old, and worried sick.
I live in France so hope it's OK to seek help from a British site. I am British and lived in France for 19 years so all my treatment has been here.

ovarian,Question,JamesF22,Pembrolizumab and lenvatinib,"
Hi is anyone on the forum receiving immunotherapy with 
Pembrolizumab and lenvatinib for metastatic endometrial cancel which has spread to the lungs?
the research seems encouraging reference FYI

The combination of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib has emerged as an effective treatment for advanced, previously treated endometrial cancer. Pembrolizumab is an anti-programmed death 1 monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between programmed death 1 and programmed death ligands 1 and 2, and has been shown to be effective in the treatment of a variety of solid tumor types, including mismatch repair-deficient endometrial cancer. (https://ijgc.bmj.com/content/32/1/93)

ovarian,Question,JamesF22,Pembrolizumab and lenvatinib,"
Hi is anyone on the forum receiving immunotherapy with 
Pembrolizumab and lenvatinib for metastatic endometrial cancel which has spread to the lungs?
the research seems encouraging reference FYI

The combination of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib has emerged as an effective treatment for advanced, previously treated endometrial cancer. Pembrolizumab is an anti-programmed death 1 monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between programmed death 1 and programmed death ligands 1 and 2, and has been shown to be effective in the treatment of a variety of solid tumor types, including mismatch repair-deficient endometrial cancer.

ovarian,Question,Quiet lemur,Symptoms,"
Hello, I’m new here and can’t stop worrying. I have persistent bloating, increasing abdo pain around my bladder/womb/ovary area, some weight loss and some loss of appetite/feeling full some evenings. Bloods were normal in May, CA125 5. An Ultrasound showed urinary retention but didn’t check repro organs. I’m awaiting CT scan results, as pain unexplained (originally diagnosed as UTI earlier this year). GP is unconcerned, as I’m young(ish), pre-menopause and CA125 normal. I’m hoping for answers with ct results but what I would like to know is whether anyone could almost feel a mass - like when bending over, when sitting or drawing my legs up? It feels like something is pressing into me when my abdo area is squashed? GP couldn’t feel any lumps externally.  It is getting worse each month, but GP unconcerned about cancer, I’m sure they must think I’m neurotic as they know I feel worried. Gut instinct says something feels wrong - I don’t know what to think anymore? Could it be a cyst? Has anyone else experienced constant pressing pain/discomfort when bending over? Tia

Hello,

My mom had Grade 3 Stage 2 ovarian cancer. She had hysterectomy and it's been a year ago since her radiation. But she still deals with symptoms how have you been able to manage with Vagina dryness and vagina burning. Vagina burning she normal complains about this when she is been sitting in the car for more than 30 minutes so I'm assuming when she's in hot temperature. We live in Texas so we're now no longer in the 3 digits temperature. Also she does us vagina moisturizers that were recommended by her gynecologist. What have you used and did still have symptoms after a year.

ovarian,Question,jende,Second opinion for advanced ovarian cancer,"
Hi,
I'm desperately looking for some other possible treatment options for my mum. She's 71 and was diagnosed in May this year. She's just been told that after 2 sessions of chemo, it doesn't seem to be working and they've offered weekly paclitaxel or palliative care. The oncologist says the paclitaxel is unlikely to work. My mum's bowel is totally blocked due to tumours on the outside of it but it's apparently too much to have surgery. 
We are all obviously devastated by this news, particularly as it seems to have come out of the blue and so quickly after diagnosis. We're going to get a second opinion, probably from the Royal Marsden, and have started the process of requesting mum's medical records as that's what they've said they'll need. I'm thinking it might be good to ask for another opinion from elsewhere as well but I'm not really sure how this works. Can you just approach other hospitals and ask them for a second opinion? We're in Scotland and I imagine most of the hospitals we'd want to get in touch with would be in England. Does going privately speed things up? Obviously time is a massive factor here.
We've also been reading about plasma jet surgery and wondering if that would be an option here. Because of the bowel blockage, mum has lost a lot of weight and is being fed by TPN. She's also not as mobile because she's been hooked up to a drain. I've read that Plasma jet is minimally invasive but I'm not sure if she'd be considered too frail for surgery. She's going to ask her oncologist about this but I'm aware it's not available up here. Would we have to go directly to somewhere that offers it? 
Thanks so much for taking the time to read this. I'd be so grateful for any advice anyone has. I just want to find another alternative to palliative care.

ovarian,Question,Annajh071,Ovarian cancer vs IBS,"
My mum went to hospital with symptoms of loss of appetite, bloating, pain from the right rib, down the same side, back and lower stomach. She was initially told she had a bacterial infection in stomach or where her gallbladder used to be and was prescribed antibiotics. Once finishing these, she still had symptoms so went back. Another doctor found a mass in the left ovary using a 'simple iltrasound' (he insinutated this wasnt the best source of scan) and couldn't provide any further detail. We paid for a transvaginal and ultrasound privately - we were told there is a 4cm complex cyst with 'solid components' on the left ovary, yet there was a lot of gas and was unable to see the right ovary... Today she did another ultrasound and the doctor couldn't say much, and she also did the ca125 blood test - results pending. Another GP we spoke to suggested the chest pain was indigestion. It seems odd the pain she is experiencing is on the other side of where the complex cyst is. I know there are people out there who have unfortunately been diagnosed with IBS and ovarian cancer has been missed. Has anyone experienced anything similar or have been going through cancer screening yet the pain in the opposite side turned out to be IBS or anything similar? She is 57 slightly overweight, has high blood pressure. She says she has more diahroea than normal, loss of appetite and some foods make her feel worse such as breads and pastas. She has no bleeding.

It seems odd the pain she is experiencing is on the other side of where the complex cyst is. I know there are people out there who have unfortunately been diagnosed with IBS and ovarian cancer has been missed. Has anyone experienced anything similar or have been going through cancer screening yet the pain in the opposite side turned out to be IBS or anything similar? She is 57 slightly overweight, has high blood pressure. She says she has more diahroea than normal, loss of appetite and some foods make her feel worse such as breads and pastas. She has no bleeding.

ovarian,Question,FreddieWhippet,"Surgery this week, scared","
Hi. I was diagnosed with cancer on my cervix a few weeks ago and referred for an MRI. At the same time my abdomen ballooned and I was told I had a large mass on my ovary and ascites. It got so bad I’m now in hospital and the ascites has been draining since Thursday. On Wednesday I think I’m having a radical hysterectomy to take ovaries away too. They strongly believe I have both cervical and ovarian cancer. Has anyone else had this? They scanned my chest on Friday and all I’ve been told about that was that my surgeon would discuss the results and surgery options with me on Monday. I’m scared out of my mind tbh. I’ve never had any health issues and now all this. I’m told my cervix cancer would probably by hysterectomy and no further treatment but the ovary is more complicated. My head is a mess.

ovarian,Question,Tracy49,Treatment,"
Hi everyone, hope you are doing okay.
I was diagnosed with stage 3c clear cell OC in Oct 2021. I had full cytoreduction at surgery. My CA125 dropped from over a 1000 to 39. I then had six cycles of carboplatin (the first included paclitaxel but unfortunately I had an allergic reaction on cycles one and two so was taken off it). My CA125 dropped to 11. My last chemo was on 9 April 22.
Unfortunately my post chemo CT scan has shown some leisions so in my oncologists words, an early recurrence and has deemed me as being ‘platinum resistant’ as the chemo obviously has not worked’. The plan was for me to go onto narapabib but that is now off the table as I have not had a response to the chemo.
I am seeing my oncologist on Thursday but from our initial conversation the options seem quite thin, particularly as I reacted to paclitaxel. He has suggested probably Caylex. I just wondered if anyone else has been in this situation and if so, is aware of any other drugs inckuding immunotherapy or of any clinical trials that could be looked into.
Thank You

Hello ladies 
I’d love some advice please. If you saw my older post, I was waiting to go to my nhs ultrasound appt today. I’m due to have a Hysteroscopy and laparoscopy for irregular bleeding. So at the appointment rosary the abdomen u/s was very quick and the sonographer raised no concerns. I emptied my bladder then came back in for a transvaginal u/s. This seemed to go on for ages! The sonographer sighed a few times and asked me how old I was, signed again. She then said ‘do you experience pain here?’ And lightly touched where I presume was my left ovary. This worried me immediately as yes that’s where I’ve been experiencing the most pain. There was more sighs and she finally said there is a cyst. I said ok. Then asked how big it was and she said I’ll remeasure it in a mo as I was getting changed. She then measured it but seemed super cagey and said we’ll have to keep an eye on it and will inform a report to my gp. I was told to take care of myself and sent on my way. Now I may be being over sensitive but she didn’t tell me the size and generally seemed concerned but didn’t say any details to me. Does this sound weird to you?  She also said there was a lot of gas. I’ve been bloated on an off for awhile but yesterday I woke with middle lower stomach pain that just wouldn’t go. By the end of the day I had indigestion/heartburn pains and overnight it woke me an I could only get light relief being hunched in a ball in bed. My lower back also really hurt. The back issue when our shopping the day before spasmed out of nowhere and I had to come home from being out. I had taken ibuprofen and paracetamol for the back pain so had presumed to at caused the bloating yesterday. Today I still have the pain and I’m super bloated. Deliberately didn’t take pain relief to see if that eased the bloating but nothing. My stomach is so sore right now I can’t wear even jogging bottoms and also at my bra line I can’t wear my bra either. there’s so much pressure in my stomach from bottom to heart level I feel like I could burst. i realise I’m rambling but it’s just a worry as it all seems to be at once.

ovarian,Question,Newstart70,Confused & in Limbo,"
Hi all, I had a trip to A&E yesterday resulting in a CT scan for gallstones which turned out a report of solid masses on both ovaries (104mm & 47mm) likely to be malignant.  Also 31mm nodule in root of mesentery probably a malignant lymph node.  The conclusion is likely bilateral ovarian tumours with possible malignant node in mesentery & suspicious looking cervix. Differential diagnosis includes primary ovarian malignancy as well as Krukenberg tumours.  I was given this report & told that they were so sorry to give me bad news in A&E then sent home slightly heady with Morphine & numb with shock.  They told me they had submitted referral to urgent Gynae Oncology & that I should hear from someone shortly but if not then to follow it up.  I feel like I'm just hanging .... Have I been diagnosed? Is it obviously bad (I think so).  I have a GP appointment on Weds next week & I'll take the report with me but does anyone have any similar experience please & what happened next?  Also does anyone know if you get to chose where you have your consultations & treatment on NHS or do you get what you're given?

Sorry load of questions but I'm feeling a bit like my worlds been turned upside down.  My house went on the market yesterday & mind is all over the place.

ovarian,Question,elsie22,Enlarged Ovaries,"
Hi, I’m 20 and I recently had a transvaginal US and the results came back as my ovaries are really big. However, my gp said the symptoms I have (heavy menstrual bleeding, intermenstrual spotting, bloating, urinary urgency, constipation) aren't usually associated with PCOS which would be the first thing to consider with enlarged ovaries due to my age. She said the US didn't show cyst formations so she has referred me to gynae and sent off for some blood tests. The phlebotomist refused to tell me what they were testing for (idk if that's regular standard or not). It's made me worried as I know from the recent experience of my friend that these are the symptoms of ovarian cancer. As well as the heavy bleeding and such my lower abdomen seems to always be stuck out even if I breathe right in and I get a pinching pain. My gynae appointment was arranged before I have my blood results and isn't until may so it's a long time to be worried. How worried should I be?

Hi all,
I am new to the group and wanted to join to connect with anyone that may be going thru the same thing my mum is & hopefully hear some positive feedback. 
my mum was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in January 2022, she was also told at the time this had spread to her bowel, stomach/diaphragm & liver and at the time they said it looked like a stage 3. 
2 days ago she had a full hysterectomy and they said they was able to remove all the visible cancer which is great news. During the operation there was a small injury to get bladder so she has a cafata in at the moment. She also had a stoma bag fitted in the op as she will be having chemo within a few weeks and they want to keep the bowel area clear. It’s really difficult as due to covid we haven’t been able to visit my mum, we have spoken to her on the phone a few times and each time she’s in so much pain and it’s heartbreaking. She has never had any major surgery and we are really worried about her. I know a hysterectomy is a major op but is it normal for her to feel this way after the 2nd day and when is this pain in her stomach meant to ease up?

Grateful for all comments!

My mum is 60. Fit and healthy with no symptoms. She found a lump under her arm and we found out yesterday she has cancer in her ovaries and it’s spread to a lymph node under her arm. We visited the Chemo doctor yesterday who said they are unable to do the surgery and remove her ovaries unless the chemo shrinks as it’s already too big. He said he doesn’t think it will shrink. I asked if he had seen anyones shrink before you in her position and he said out of a 100 people probably 5% it has worked for them.
She has to wait 3 weeks to start chemo (waiting list apparently) then is having 3 chemo sessions with 3 weeks in between them. Then they will scan again to see if it has done anything.
has anyone been in a similar situation and has any advice?

My mother was diagnosed with peritoneal and ovarian cancer towards the latter part of last year. She had three courses of carbotaxol then had a successful op.  She’s having Avastin added after her next two chemos then ten Avastins over thirty weeks.  Just wondering if anyone suffered any side effects and how they found the treatment?  
Thank you x

ovarian,Question,Bentley51,Stage overian cancer,"
Hi. My mum got diagnosed with overian cancer stage four in December. She has been told she also has fluid on her lungs. Mum starts chemotherapy next week, hoping she will have 3 sessions then have a full hysterectomy followed by more chemotherapy. My concern is how week she is. She can hardly walk up the stairs with feeling out if breath, I'm assuming that's due to the fluid. Is that likely to change once she has chemotherapy? I just can't see how she will stay positive when she is struggling to move around the house. No body has mentioned draining the fluid, should we be asking about this as an option? 
Thanks xx

ovarian,Question,Rikl123,Caelyx - side effects?,"
Hi
I've just started my second round of chemo - previously I was on Carbo / Paclitaxol / Avastin.  This time I'm Carbo / Caelyx.  The Onco has given me the usual 'side-effects' sheet which basically seems to list all the same stuff as every other drug - nausea / hair loss / bowel issues ...  I have been told that generally Caelyx can be quite well tolerated, but then also that since i've got 'previous', sometimes the side effects sort of cumulate.   So far I've had one dose and just experienced a fair bit more nausea than before (for some reason they didn't prescribe nausea tablets this time, but fortunately I have loads left from last time). 
Just wondered if anyone else had experience of Caelyx vs anything else and if there's any particular side effects I might have ahead of me ;)

ovarian,Question,Sarah16,Peripheral Neuropathy after first treatment of Carboplatin,"
Hello
I'm looking for some advice please.  I had my first chemo session on Wednesday (15th December 2021) with single agent Carboplatin (and that is the only chemo drug I will require).  This is the first of six cycles of this drug that I will receive.  This was given to me at approx 10.30-11.30am on Wednesday and by 7pm I had a tingling and a warm feeling in my feet and then a couple of hours later a tingling sensation in my hands but that only lasted half an hour.  The tingling in my feet lasted longer. 
I believe this is a common side effect of the chemo (Carboplatin) that I am on.  The tingling has gone but I will raise it when I next go back to the hospital for my second treatment and with my consultant who is due to phone me the day before my second treatment. 
This sensation had gone by 10.30pm on the Wednesday evening however I would be very grateful to hear from anybody who has had experience of this and what they have been advised.  I'm not in any pain from it and it was for a relatively short period of time however what I don't want is to be left with some long term side effects if there is something I can do now to mitigate that risk.
Thank you for any guidance on this.

ovarian,Question,Tracy49,CA125 and Chemo,"
Hi. I have been diagnosed with stage 3c ovarian cancer. I had de-bulking surgery eight weeks ago where all visible cancer was removed. I am due to start chemo next week. My CA125 was originally over 1000. It then reduced to 254 just prior to my surgery and this week is 39 so almost normal. I know this can be an unreliable marker but that it is used during chemo to measure its efficacy. As it is nearly normal I am wondering if having chemo is worth it due to the risks involved, particularly as my spleen was removed during surgery so I am already immune compromised. I guess it should be a discussion with the oncologist but wondered if anyone else had had the same experience. Thanks.

ovarian,Question,Frightened01,Ct scan after mri,"
Hi I hope someone can help.
I had an ultrasound recently that found a 9cm mass on my ovary I’ve had ca125 done which was 1322 I don’t know much but I know that’s high. I seen the gyno for the first time the other day before my mri and she was really blasay about everything and said it’s be nothing to worry about we’ll do the checks but I probably won’t need them. As you can imagine I felt really relived but after my mri a different gyno called and said she won’t give me my results back until I’ve had a ct scan and referred me urgently for a ct scan so as you can imagine now I’m worried again. Surely if it was nothing to worry about they would have seen that on the contrast mri? Right? Why would they need a ct as well? 
any help would be really appreciated as I’m trying to stay calm until I get the results and not panic but it’s becoming hard. I’ve not got my 2nd gyno app until the 17th of dec either so it’s a long time to wait.

ovarian,Question,,Ovarian cancer and kidney failure,"
I was diagnosed with Stage 4 ovarian cancer in February,  I was put on Paclitaxel chemotherapy in March, my scan mid through treatment showed improvement and that it was working.  However in July the chemo was stopped because of a drop in my kidney function.  They scanned me again and said there was no change from last scan and I was stable so there was no point putting me back on Paclitaxel so they are looking at Carboplatin chemo next.  but they won’t put me on it yet as EGFR is 14 and the cancer is stable.  I am keen to re-commence chemo as soon as necessary and my nephrologist has said he is happy for me to be put on it straight away and if it damages my kidney further they will put me on dialysis immediately.  However my oncologist has said that if my kidney function is still 14 she won’t put me on it and she thinks I should be put on dialysis now in preparation of re-starting chemo so at the moment I have conflicting opinions. 
I am wondering if anyone is in a similar position and you are on Carboplatin whilst being in renal failure ? xx

ovarian,Question,FormerMember,CA 125 marker still high and rising,"
Hi,
First time posting, been reading a few posts and in need of a positivity boost as I'm a little worried and anxious. Have just had 6th infusion of chemo, ca125 marker was at 88 before 5th infusion but now rising again to 98, it never got down to the 35 or below level, so I'm worried my chemo hasn't worked. Grade 2c diagnosis back in April.

I had surgery in May this year but bowel was stuck to everything and a large fibroid in the uterus made it awkward so just ovaries removed and some debulking surgery. Spread across abdomen to bowel and bladder. 6 weeks later chemo started with paclitaxel and carboplatin. I haven't suffered much, just hair loss and some tingling/numbness. So feel lucky so far. I got stressed after 4th infusion as got bloating, urge to wee more and pains back. I'm trying not to worry, but easier said than done!

How many rounds have others had? Did CA125 level get to normal during the first round usually?

Ι am 32 years old I was diagnosed with a dermoid cyst (January 2021) and I was told but my gyn to remove it but I didn't have to rush since dermoid cysts are mostly benign. Finally I  removed it (August 2021) and unfortunatelly the biopsy showed cancer cells on the cyst. Now I am advised to remove my ovary and tube and send them for biopsy. I hope they are clear. If they are not clear the suggect full hysterectomy and chemo. I am 32 and doctors said it is quite rare incident.
Are there any similar incidents/stories.
I am terrified. I think that my life is in danger. I have two children.

ovarian,Question,,Chemo advice,"
Hi all,
Have recently been diagnosed with low grade (1c) ovarian cancer. I've had a full hysterectomy 5 weeks ago and now waiting to start chemo in a few weeks. All being well with a few other tests I should just be having carboplatin every three weeks or so for 6 treatments.
Just wondering what to expect from the chemo i.e.do the side effects tend to get worse with each course of treatment or is it really just pot luck/down to each individual how it affects you?

Thanks

Hi
Ive got stage 4b ovarian cancer (seromucinous adenocarcinoma) metastasised to my pelvic, par aortic and peritoneal lymph nodes and now my skin.
I had one round of carboplatin and paclitaxel but am platinum resistant now and have just finished a round of radiotherapy. Six weeks after the radiotherapy finished and I’ve just been diagnosed with a spread to my skin. I understand this is rather rare and was just wondering if anyone else has experienced this and had any experiences to share. 
Any insights welcome.

ovarian,Question,,Really confused and shocked,"
I am 47 years old and recently discovered I was unexpectedly pregnant which resulted in a miscarriage at 8 weeks. Having had a couple of ultrasounds all seemed clear of pregnancy but to rule out an ectopic I had an internal scan again all was clear but the nurse mentioned I had a 4cm cyst on my ovary but not to be concerned. Over the next couple of weeks I had to go to hospital every other day because my HG levels were not coming down as quickly as they would expect and after each test a doctor rang me with the results and the cyst was never mentioned. Then on my last blood test the doctor called to advise my HG levels had finally come down to a negative level but had anyone discussed my cyst and i said no so she said ill just request some further tests on your blood. Heard nothing, i went on holiday and returned at the weekend to a hospital appointmemt for next monday with a gyn oncologist....and I am just dumbfounded I don't know why or what this means, should I be concerned or is this normal for an ovarian cyst

My mum 89 has fluid on her lungs and their best guess is that it is a gynaecological cancer.
She has been offered chemotherapy and I went with her to the appointment that explained all the details. Even though she seemed to understand what was happening she is now talking about a second opinion and seems to not have taken on board what was said at the last appointment.
I am worried that asking for a second opinion that will no doubt confirm the original diagnosis will mean that the chemotherapy will be less effective because it will be started later.
I understand that she’s struggling to come to terms with the diagnosis and I don’t want to bully her. What should I do?

ovarian,Question,,Advice needed please!,"
Hi everyone - I am seeking any advice for my sister.
Full details below -
Always had painful periods and horrible tummy either constipated or opposite for years. 
After during her pregnancy with second child 18 months ago she started with horrific pelvic pain. 
After birth the pain continued - both back and pelvic pain until she could not push pram or lean over to pick child up. Her period returned only 8 weeks after the baby arrived even though breast feeding and along with horrific constipation - she now has to have laxatives daily to try and be normal.
After a prolapse and many doctors appointments she was in horrific pain in pelvis and back she paid for private MRI scan which showed bone marrow edema of the pubic bone. She had some physio but pain continued to be horrific - she felt it worse in back. Along with this her tummy has swollen to look like 6 months  pregnant- living on laxatives and struggling to cope with pain so was put on naproxen which made her have dizzy spells and more constipation and anger. Came off these and was put on anti depressants to depress the nerves in her back.
She was referred to MSK and they sent her for second MRI - this has shown fluid in the endometrial cavity - high intensity ovarian cysts and with some hemmirogic content. 
- Doctors have not rung her - she has been on phone for this last week trying to get through. The notes on latest MRI said to book in for a ultrasound. Today she went for a private ultrasound and they said no cysts and overies look fine. But her lymph nodes are very swollen. And told her to boost her immune system!!!! How can this be causing such pain she can’t push the pram or play with her children. How can both things be different. She looks very thin apart from her swollen tummy and gets full quickly - she looks pail and always tired. Her periods are Very painful and naproxen and paracetamol won’t touch the sides. 
What do we do next - I feel something is really not right and don’t want to waist time.  Manchester area. 
Anyone had similar experiences getting diagnosis or symptoms. 
Many thanks in advance x x

ovarian,Question,,Ultra radical surgery,"
I was diagnosed with 3c overian cancer o  christmas eve. In and out of hospital for my first 3 chemo sessions were as an inpatient due to fluid needing draining.  No op offered at this stage but to.ors and markers had reduced.
Had further 3 sessions and then a discussion regarding surgery  agreed to a laparoscopy  to look at the situation further. This was done today feeling g ok going g home tomorrow  could have gone today. But after talking g to surgeon  wanted time to digest what he said. So have stayed tonight .
I have been offered the above surgery. Who else has had this. Although my c125 levels have gone from 1589 in dec to 217 now. The actual tumours and cancer if fairly active. Last chemo was 9 weeks ago. 
I ve an appointment on 3rd sept to discuss decision as he want op done in next 4 weeks. Is it normally that quick.also looks like a permanent stoma bag too.
I know only I can make this choice but I am scared and confused.

ovarian,Question,,Nearly finished first round of chemo,"
Hi all, looking for some advice or just similar stories to make me feel like i’m not the only one in the world going through this! Long story short, I had an ovarian cyst removed in November 2020 which was about 15cm but I was told it had no cancer markers and seemed benign. 8 weeks later I received a call from the hospital asking me to come in for a CT scan which I thought was very weird, 1 hour later they called again and said could I come in to speak to the consultant. I thought it was very strange at the time but just put it to the back of my mind. The next day comes and they tell me the dreaded C word.. the biopsy showed stage 1 cancerous cells so they diagnosed me with ‘germ cell cancer’. I started chemotherapy end of February and since then i’ve not felt the same, physically and mentally. I’m not sure how to take these thoughts out my head... what if the chemo doesn’t work? what if it makes me worse? Can the chemo kill me? I now have low white blood cells too so that is also playing on my mind as they have said i am neutropenic. Will my thoughts go away? How do I make myself feel better? I am only 25 so feel too young to be going through all of this :(

Long story short, I had an ovarian cyst removed in November 2020 which was about 15cm but I was told it had no cancer markers and seemed benign. 8 weeks later I received a call from the hospital asking me to come in for a CT scan which I thought was very weird, 1 hour later they called again and said could I come in to speak to the consultant. I thought it was very strange at the time but just put it to the back of my mind. The next day comes and they tell me the dreaded C word.. the biopsy showed stage 1 cancerous cells so they diagnosed me with ‘germ cell cancer’. I started chemotherapy end of February and since then i’ve not felt the same, physically and mentally. I’m not sure how to take these thoughts out my head... what if the chemo doesn’t work? what if it makes me worse? Can the chemo kill me? I now have low white blood cells too so that is also playing on my mind as they have said i am neutropenic. Will my thoughts go away? How do I make myself feel better? I am only 25 so feel too young to be going through all of this :(

ovarian,Question,,waiting for surgery,"
Seems fairly definite I have cancer, and the way ahead is surgery.  Is anyone else waiting for surgery, or anyone with a date for surgery.  Would really help to find out your waiting time and how you stay positive in the meantime.  I don't think I have a valid choice, seems surgery is the best way forward and I accept that.  My symptoms seem to get worse.
Sharing your feelings if you are 'waiting' could be good and I would like to chat with anyone in a similar place.  I am usually a positive person but we all lapse and need a transfusion of support and back up.

ovarian,Question,Melo99,First cycle of chemo fears - help needed,"
Hi, i am near the end of my first cycle of chemotherapy for stage IV ovarian cancer.  I am feeling very scared as i have had a very rough ride with bad constipation and generally feeling like the symptoms of the cancer are getting worse with fairly continual heartburn and problems overall with digestion and gurgling etc and general pains in the tumours area.  it really doesn't feel like the chemotherapy is working at all and i'm very scared that if the CA125 levels come back on Thursday higher and there is no sign that the chemo has worked that this is the end of the line for me with no further treatment.
has anyone else experienced this?

ovarian,Question,,Words of wisdom,"
Hi everyone
 I don’t know where to start, I’ve been reading through the message boards and everyone is so supportive so thought I’d ask some questions.
 My mum was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer in December 2019, she had a growth in her womb and it had spread to her bowel. After receiving Taxol every 3 weeks she had surgery in May that was deemed successful, they did a full hysterectomy and all signs of the spread were gone. Fast forward to December 2020 and her CA125 had gone up to the 80s and a scan showed it was back with spots on the out side of her lungs and again her bowel. She started taxol once a week for 3 weeks, week off cycle for 18 weeks and is on a trial drug Cediranib. She feels so rough between bouts of constipation and diarrhoea, she’s going to struggle to get through the 18 weeks. Her BP isn’t great and the stress just elevates it,  knowing dad is outside on a parking meter for 6 hours every time just worries her, and you can imagine what dad is like.  Because of COVID she’s on her own with treatment, consultants, scans and results. We can’t ask questions and mum is too scared to. I’m was just wondering if any one else has taken the trial drugs, or been in the same position and got through it second time around. I want to give support but google can be so scary I can’t look at it any more. She hasn’t had a CA125 result since she started, her scan and full bloods were yesterday with results on Tuesday, again on her own, it’s so scary.
 Thanks in advance, C x

ovarian,Question,,End of treatment fears...,"
Hi all,
I’m not sure what I’m hoping for here, but maybe just hoping that other people have the same fears...! 
14 months ago I was diagnosed with Stage IV ovarian cancer. I’ve had 6 rounds of chemo, and debulking surgery which removed 3 tumours (on my right ovary, bowel, and omentum); since April I’ve been on Avastin every 3 weeks. Now I have only three Avastin treatments to go and I’m starting to feel worried about what next. How will I cope without knowing every 3 weeks that things are still ok? 
And now I have an extra worry creeping in as today’s Avastin has been delayed because the last few times there’s been protein in my urine. I’ve done a 24-hour urine test this week (oh what fun!) but the results aren’t back yet. If they’re not ok, they’ll do another test in a week or so, and if they’re still not ok, will start looking at renal things. In the back of my kind there is of course the worry of what if this is the cancer back again?
I know the stats for my prognosis only too well. Most of the time I can push them out of my mind - but I’ve recently been feeling very aware that we’re a year on, and that’s a year nearer it being bad again, whenever that it. How have others come to terms with this, or reframed it in a better way? 
I usually try to be positive about things - there is so much good, even with all this. My treatments have gone well, the cancer responded really well to the chemo, and the surgery went better than we’d ever dared to dream. But I figure this is a safe space to have a wobble, so here I am, wobbling!

ovarian,Question,,Highly anxious about my 74 year old mum starting chemotherapy,"
Hi all,

Im new to this group. My mum was diagnosed with stage 3c advanced ovarian cancer last month, and we were told she would only have a short few months to live. However there was the option to try some chemotherapy with the view of stopping the spread of the cancer and to try and reduce the size of both tumours on the left and right ovaries and to facilitate  a de bulking surgery which could potentially make her very ill. Due to some cognitive decline the consultant is concerned that this could dramatically affect her quality of life and make her extremely ill. It’s probably been the worst month of my life and am extremely anxious about her starting carboplatin chemotherapy as I have heard about the most horrific side effects but realistically there is no other choice and this was her decision. We had awful option number 1 or awful option 2, what are we supposed to do?
if anyone has any tips or suggestions as to how I could help my mum and my poor dad I would be so grateful.

Thank you, Mand

ovarian,Question,,Highly anxious about my 74 year old mum starting chemotherapy,"
Hi all,

Im new to this group. My mum was diagnosed with stage 3c advanced ovarian cancer last month, and we were told she would only have a short few months to live. However there was the option to try some chemotherapy with the view of stopping the spread of the cancer and to try and reduce the size of both tumours on the left and right ovaries and to facilitate  a de bulking surgery which could potentially make her very ill. Due to some cognitive decline the consultant is concerned that this could dramatically affect her quality of life and make her extremely ill. It’s probably been the worst month of my life and am extremely anxious about her starting carboplatin chemotherapy as I have heard about the most horrific side effects but realistically there is no other choice and this was her decision. We had awful option number 1 or awful option 2, what are we supposed to do?
if anyone has any tips or suggestions as to how I could help my mum and my poor dad I would be so grateful.

Thank you, Mand

ovarian,Question,Bella H,Abnormal Ovaries and Endometrial Cancer,"
Hello, I’m 37, I had a TV ultrasound in December due to heavy periods and spotting. I have suffered with PCOS for about 18 years. They said I had a 23mm lining and a 2.5cm cyst with some echogenic material. GP said the cyst was ok just needed to keep a check on it for growth and nothing to worry about but he referred my for a hysteroscopy for the lining. I was then diagnosed with Endometrial cancer, grade 1. I had an MRI scan which came back saying there was a 3cm mass on my ovary and the ovary looked abnormal. She said there was a possibility that the cancer had spread to this ovary or a separate ovarian cancer. I then had the CA125 test which came back normal and was sent for a CT scan which has shown no further spread and lymph nodes look okay. I then went to see the surgeon in January who looked really concerned and said that both ovaries looked abnormal and would need to do full abdominal hysterectomy including Omentum and lymph nodes. This terrifies me as I have never had an operation before and this sounds huge. He said it could be the cancer has spread to the ovaries or a separate ovarian cancer. He said there was a very very small chance they could not be cancerous. I can’t understand why the abnormal ovaries didn’t show on the ultrasound scan. I was supposed to have my operation this week but it’s been cancelled. I am so worried if it’s an ovarian cancer that it’s aggressive and spreading while I wait for the operation. I have no idea what grade or stage that would be and I’m so scared.  Could there be other things that make them look abnormal? He said they see PCOS everyday so it’s not that. So sorry for the long rant I’m just so worried right now.

ovarian,Question,,Suddenly told won't do operation - confused.,"
Hello, thanks for letting me join.  I hope some of you can let me know if you've had any similar experiences to us! My MiL was diagnosed with bilateral ovarian cancer in June 2020. She was initially told her treatment would be ""three doses of chemo, surgery, three more doses of chemo"" but ended up being about 12 doses of chemo as we were told the local hospital couldn't do the op at that time because of Covid, and that they would 'ask' another local cancer hospital if they would do the op. The other hospital looked at one of her scans in September and said they wouldn't do the op, based on the scan. Her MDT at her regular hospital then had a meeting and decided that based on recent scans, they have decided they won't do the op at all. We are extremely concerned about this decision, especially as it seems like they would have done one earlier on if it wasn't for Covid, and because her oncologist said the decision was 'heated' at the meeting which suggests some of those present thought the op should happen? It's now been a few weeks since the last chemo and the ascites is back quite badly, she's gone in for a drain today. Her oncologist told her over Christmas that he is surprised the ascites has returned so fast, as in the last scan after the last chemo in November, it was all gone. Should we try and get a second opinion about the operation, or is that just wishful thinking?

ovarian,Question,FormerMember,Lynparza and neuropathy,"
I have a BRCA2 mutation. I was first diagnosed with stage IIIc ovarian cancer in 2013. I went through surgery and 4 months of chemo with taxol and carbo-platin.
I had a recurrence diagnosed in 2017, tho my CA-125 levels were rising for a year and the tumor was not located due to a radiology screwup.
I went through a second round of chemo, with carbo-platin and doxil, which put me back in remission.
Then my oncologist prescribed lynparza. 
Since I started lynparza, I have been having increasing neuropathy. At first it was only in the left leg and my doctor thought it was a pinched nerve, because neuropathy is rare with lynparza.  Then the neuropathy spread to both legs and started to become painful.  Now it's in my face.  This has been gradually increasing over a month and a half while I have been taking this drug.
Neither the doctor nor the pharmacist seem to know much about neuropathy and lynparza.  It is a relatively rare side effect.  We're still not sure that the lynparza is causing it. I'm going to see a neurologist later this week to find out more about what is going on with me. 
In the mean time, I'm taking a vacation from the lynparza, which worries my oncologist, because she feels I really need this drug.  I've been off for four days. I haven't seen any improvement in the neuropathy during that four days.
Is there anyone out there who has experience with lynparza and neuropathy? It seems like this is a relatively new drug and people don't really understand about it. I'd like to hear what your experience is.

ovarian,Question,FormerMember,Waiting for results.,"
Hi, 
I've just joined this group as a 'mass' was found on my right ovary during an mri on my spine. I had an appointment with my gynecologist last week who did an internal examination and has requested a scan ASAP. 
I don't know whether it's anything to worry about or not so only my partner knows about it.
I am 40 and I have four children (24, 18, 5 & 4)
I guess I'm just wanting somewhere to go to vent and ask questions, so here I am 
I've been telling my gp for about 18 months, maybe longer, that there was something not right in that area. I'm furious, scared, anxious and impatient. I just want to know what I'm dealing with! ￼

Hi All
I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer at the beginning of the year. I had the tumor and a full hysterectomy in Feb.
I then had 4 chemo sessions (Paclitaxel & Carboplatin) and then a 2nd op in July, to remove the rest of tumur and my left kidney.
I have just had the 5th (out of 6) chemo sessions. 
The doctor has mentioned going on Avastin, which may last 12 to 18 months.
I'm a little concerned about the side effects and the duration of the treatment. 
Has everyone had experience of Avastin and it's side effects. I am also keen to get back to work (I have been off since January).
Many thanks all.

Hi ladies. I’m 23 (24 in less than a month) and I was diagnosed last week Thursday  (2nd July) with ovarian cancer as suspected. I’m now waiting for surgery. I’m expecting a call tomorrow with a date. My tumour is on my left ovary and is 15cm in diameter. They think it is a germ cell tumour and will stage and grade me when they go in for surgery. I’m a little scared. I have had plenty of operations before but never such large incisions. (They have told me i will  be cut straight down from just above my belly button down to my pubic bone). I’m trying to be strong for everyone in my family as they have all taken it pretty hard (as to be expected) but it’s getting hard now. I didn’t realise just how big 15cm is until I took out a measuring tape last night  any advice for before/after surgery? How did it go? Did you need chemo after? I have been told I will only know if I need chemo after once they have done the surgery  xxx

ovarian,Question,shellyp,bumpy wound after open surgery,"
Hi Everyone, 
Hope whatever stage you are at in your journey you are the best as can be.
Thought i would ask this question. 4wks Post OP open surgery and the top part of the wound is healing great but below belly button i have a wound infection which has been treated with 1wks worth of antibiotics. The area is still red but oncologst didnt seem to worried about it but thought it best to delay my 1st session of chemo and re-schedule for next week. Also below my belly button the actual wound feels a bit hard and bumpy? Has anyone else came across this? 
Would love to hear from anyone that has had this experience or anyone that has an explanation?

Recently went to my GP thinking I had hernia as had felt a lump in my stomach and was referred to hernia consultant for appt just before lockdown.  Had to go back to GP for something else but also mentioned to him that I hadn't heard back from the hospital but wondered if the hernia could be causing problems  as had started experiencing uncomfortable bloating and occassionally finding that when waking up in the morning found that I had passed urine without any warning.  He decided fortunately for me to do some further blood tests and to organise an ultra sound.  My CA125 test came back raised at 113.  I was immediately referred for an urgent appointment to ultrasound and gynae/oncologist.  I was a bit shocked.  Everything has been moving so quick as found I had an approx 30cms mass in my pelvic area and  CTscan showed comng from the ovary.  I had a hysterectomy in 2007, 13 years ago but had opted to leave my ovaries in. I am in the middle of my appointments now, had been told possible options would be to chemo first, surgery and chemo after as mass so large.  However, when discussing CT results over the phone, was told that the team had decided on surgery first when they would also do a biopsy to see if cancer, also found a couple of suspicious lumps on my peritoneum.  I haven't had much time to get my head around all this and of course have been googling, looking at all the forums etc.  I feel well in myself, all my other bloods came back good and ca125 reading, because under 200 was told a grey area.  I feel like I'm about 8 months pregnant and even find myself waddling like a pregnant duck, even though there is no possibility I'm pregnant !!!
Looking on this forum, have seen many people have had chemo first before surgery and some of the surgery mentioned seems to have taken a long time, 5-8hrs.  Has anybody else had such a large mass or does anyone know why surgery first is sometimes the option.  My head is going round and round and all I know is I want this thing out but the thought of 5-8 hours surgery petrifies me.  Would appreciate anyone getting back to me.

Hello everyone. My mum had her debulking surgery today. It took 8 hours and the surgeon said it went well. However she lost 4.5 litres of blood and is being kept asleep overnight so her body can rest. They will bring her round tomorrow and take the breathing tube out. Is there anyone who has had a similar experience and can share how their recovery was after surgery? We are all so worried about her after such a big operation and we can’t even visit because of Covid.

ovarian,Question,,Best Ovarian Cancer Specialist please!,"
Hi all,

Extremely scared, worried and looking for advice. 

We found out last Thursday (2nd July 2020) from CT scan that my mum has grade 3 ovarian cancer. It has spread to the peritoneum. she has ascites and raised ca125. Yesterday she had three litres of fluid drained from her tummy. 

They now want her to have a biopsy (on Tuesday) for a full diagnosis and await results and then be discussed at an MDT meeting at Worcester Royal hospital which in total won’t take place for more than two weeks! Then once they’ve discussed that they will decide on chemotherapy /surgery and more chemotherapy and this could all take further weeks! 

I’m not happy with all this waiting around. I’ve read that it’s very important to get in there early. 

My question to everyone here is does anyone know of or can recommend where to get the best ovarian cancer treatment? I’m looking for the best gynaecologist oncologist surgeons who will act quickly to treat my mum. Nhs or private! 

Please give any recommendations and personal experiences!

Much love

ovarian,Question,,stage 4a ovarian cancer,"
Hi
please can someone help or offer advice - I was diagnosed in November with ovarian cancer but this has never been confirmed as the primary source. my treatment was started early jan but suspended in march due to covid so I never finished my cycle.  Since then it has spread and I have been re started on a new treatment Irinotecan but I notice this is mainly for bowel cancers which I have never had a problem with.   I have been slightly anaemic and suffer from occasional pleural enfusions.
I am confused as to the questions I should be asking my oncologist - ie. what is the life span of this illness etc I am only 47 and there is so much I want to do.   I don't feel that I am in control of this illness as its on my mind all the time at the moment.  Please can someone just talk to me...………..

Hi All,
Having had my surgery cancelled after 3 chemo cycles, it is now scheduled for 29 May which is after 4 cycles. I am expecting it to be a TAH BSO and to emerge with a large wound from belly button to pubes (what’s left of them!). I tend to focus on the little logistical details rather than the major worries (pain, complications etc), so my question is: what kind of pants will I need?! I’m assuming Bridget Jones type, up to my armpits, but how many sizes bigger should I go and which ones are nice and stretchy etc etc?
Also, any other tips for anything that will make my stay in hospital and return home easier would be much appreciated!
Many thanks and best wishes, Nell xxx

ovarian,Question,,"Giant complex cyst removed, anxiously waiting for results","
Hello, 
I had emergency surgery to remove a giant ovarian cyst (20cm) on Friday. This all happened out of the blue, I've been having worsening symptoms for 4 weeks now and the pain became excruciating (turned out my ovary was being twisted) before I finally got seen by a doctor and was sent straight up to hospital. The surgery went well, they removed the cyst, an ovary, fallopian tube and my appendix. They have warned me that there is a chance it could be a borderline tumour or cancer. My CA125 was 194 when they checked and they said the cyst looks 'irregular'. It also seems like it has grown very fast. I'm just waiting for the results from the lab which I should get next week hopefully. Just wondering if anyone has any similar experiences to share? Has anyone had a complex cyst plus raised CA125 and it's turned out to not be cancer? I'm only 27 so I know my risk of ovarian cancer is small but they were really stressing their concerns about the nature of the cyst to me in hospital which is making me very anxious. 
Also, my mum (64) was diagnosed with aggressive terminal brain cancer a mere 7 weeks ago which is inoperable and untreatable. I feel like I've got de ja vu and history is repeating itself. I am unable to continue my care duties for my mum as I'm not allowed to lift her which is filling me with guilt and a sense of helplessness. 
I almost feel like I'm in a bit of limbo right now, not knowing exactly what the thing they have removed is. I want to know the results but equally I'm scared this will be opening yet another difficult and devastating chapter of my life. I can't believe how much bad luck I've had over the last couple of months. It's overwhelming.

vulval,Question,Kmac123,Aldara for VIN,"
Hello
I am on week 8 of Aldara cream for VIN. I have had horrendous reactions and felt very ill with it ( 5 days on 2 off) 
The last week I have stopped having a reaction, I'm still tired with it and feel unwell but no reaction to the actual cream. All my blisters and sores have cleared and I am almost back to normal.

vulval,Question,Kmac123,Aldara for VIN,"
Hello
I am on week 8 of Aldara cream for VIN. I have had horrendous reactions and felt very ill with it ( 5 days on 2 off) 
The last week I have stopped having a reaction, I'm still tired with it and feel unwell but no reaction to the actual cream. All my blisters and sores have cleared and I am almost back to normal. 

Does anyone know if this means it's stopped working? I have another 6 weeks to go but nothing is happening now so I'm not sure if it's got it all or stopped working 

Thank you in advance

vulval,Question,Pt17srdg,"Possibly vulvar melanoma for years, scared out of my mind and no support :(","
Around 2-3 years ago I noticed some pigmentation on my labia. I was only 22 at the time and it didn’t hurt, itch or was raised so I just presumed it was nothing. I also came off the pill around this time and put it down to that.
I saw a private gynae August 2023 who diagnosed me with PCOS and endometriosis, she mentioned these patches of pigmentation looked like vulvar melanosis and as I’d had them for so long and they had no symptoms that they were likely nothing, but I could follow up with a dermatologist if I wanted. 
I (maybe stupidly) took her word for it and carried on living life as normal. I’ve seen several gynae’s since and had a gynaecological surgery and nobody has mentioned them, which made me even less concerned. 
Recently I’ve been having a really tight chest and dry cough, not related to a cold. I’m short of breath all the time and losing weight. Not fatigued which is unsurprising given I barely sleep from anxiety. I’ve also had constant lower back pain for the last year, which I put down to working a desk top. 
I’ve been struggling with bad health anxiety recently. It’s completely debilitating. My GPs have done all sorts of blood tests which have come back fine and are not worried but I know how dismissive they can be to lots of people (especially women). I had a chest X ray in A&E a month ago which was clear but my uncle passed away from lung cancer and I know X rays can miss it. 
I’m so scared this is melanoma which has been progressing for 2/3 years and I’m weeks/ months away from death.
I went back to the GPs yesterday because my anxiety is unbearable and have been put on the fast track referral with an appointment next week. It’s likely they’ll do a biopsy. However, given my declining health I’m scared it may be too late, especially given the aggressive nature of this type of cancer. 
My boyfriend and mum keep saying I’m being ridiculous and all my symptoms are probably stress related but I just have such a bad gut feeling. I’m only recently 26 and I don’t want to lose my life over something that nobody ever told me was a potential issue. I feel like the GPs have completely failed me, if anyone would have mentioned melanoma to me at any point I would’ve prioritised getting checked out. 
I’m so scared and every time I try to talk about it with my family they shut me down. 
I really need support rn  all I see everywhere is horrific statistics for stage 4 mucosal melanoma and it’s so hard to accept this might be the news I receive over Christmas.

vulval,Question,Leezim,Vin 3 SSC cancer,"
Hello all. So mines a complicated one. Im going to make it short and sweet in April 24 I got a random phone call to say I had an app at the hospital the following week. I went to this appointment none the wiser to what it was actually for. Anyways turns on in 2021 I had biopsies taken but only got told results of these biopsies in April this year. I had precancerous cells ain3 in 2021 which should have been treated then. Fast forward a bit. In June I had biopsies taken from my vulva and perennial area. To which I had vin3 and told didn't have cancer. Wide local excision was done 2 weeks ago. And biopsies taken again. Yesterday I find out that I actually had SSC cancer of the vulva but was all removed and see me again in 4months. Where is my 6 week follow up. I'm still healing and in pain and was told didn't have cancer but really I did but it's all removed?? Has anyone had similar situation. I was told theses results over the phone and no further help or explanation. Just wait and see them in 4, month. All this stems from being left for 3 years and it spread. Question is how do they know they got all the cancer when they didn't think I had it in the first place. These last few months have been worst ever. So many tests. So many biopsies and an op. With more to come and no one seems bothered. Don't know how to feel or what to think. NHS fucked up big time. All this needn't have happened if I'd been dealt with properly 3 years ago. Sorry for rant

vulval,Question,BlossomSunshine,HSIL/ VIN3,"
Hello everyone,
I’m reaching out to share my recent experience and to seek some support and advice. In May, I noticed a small bump developing on a mole that I’ve had on my butt for as long as I can remember. It began to grow, itch, darken, and eventually developed a small nodule.
I decided to see my primary care doctor, who immediately referred me to a dermatologist. The dermatologist took a quick look and opted for a biopsy. After two anxious weeks, the results came back: Squamous cell carcinoma in situ with viral pathic changes, suggesting condyloma accuminatum.
Since these findings were likely linked to HPV, I was asked about my latest Pap smear, and I realized it had been five years since my last one. I quickly scheduled a follow-up.
During my gynecological exam, they discovered another suspicious lesion on my vulva. A biopsy was conducted, and a few days later, my doctor requested an immediate telehealth appointment. She explained that the biopsy showed HSIL/VIN 3.
I’m now scheduled for a pre-op appointment on the 9th to discuss a wide local excision of my vulva.
This journey has been overwhelming, and I’m both scared and hopeful. If anyone has gone through something similar or has advice on what to expect, I would greatly appreciate your insights. Thank you for letting me share my story.
Feel free to adjust the tone and details to best fit your comfort level and the specific support group you’re addressing.

vulval,Question,Anniee,Next stage after surgery,"
Hi Anniee here,
I had Anterior Vulvectomy on 4th April so in week 3 of recovery but have been hit with devistating news that all was not removed. The squamas cells have gone 4mm into the ""wall"".  My surgeon said I would require 5 wks if radium treatment every day, but since speaking with the Marsden London, they have said they prefer scan to check lymph glands and possibly remove any infected glands.  I was told this just two days ago  but to date have received no contact from the Marsden. 
I know I am expecting the wheels to turn quickly, but has anyone else had this form of treatment and do you know any time scales.

Thank you.

vulval,Question,KB3,Vulval biopsy,"
Hello All 
I am in my late 30's. I've had some growths appear. I think over the last 6-12 months. It started with two raised flat lumps. Ruled out anything sexual health related. No warts etc. Attempted cryotherapy with no resolution other than the tops turning white.
Lumps remained and never fell off. GP did an urgent referral to gynae oncology who was very dismissive but couldn't say what they were. It was an external examination. I pointed out I now have a third to which she stated an ingrown hair. After looking said it was possibly a mole. But the third appeared in two weeks. Oncologist said they were not cancerous. No biopsy taken. If I am still concerned go back to my GP and ask for a referral with genital dermatology. I am on HRT.
I was concerned and they were new. I went for a private second opinion with a consultant who specialises in sexual health and genital dermatology. He couldn't offer an explanation. The Consultant biopsied the new growth and one of the older growths. I had punch biopsies. I also had a smear. I am HPV neg (High and low risk). I am nearly two weeks into the wait. 
I am concerned as used tanning beds and tanning injections in my youth. Has anyone had private biopsies? I am struggling with the wait. I was told as the day of biopsy it would be two weeks. I have now been told it may take three weeks. 
Thank you

vulval,Question,Shelly1234,Newly diagnosed aged 46,"
I know I should be asleep (it’s 2.30am) but 12 hours ago, I got the dreaded call. They found cancer in the biopsy I had 6 weeks ago!
I had a very painful lesion on my clitoris since October and despite calls to my GP, the referral and biopsy didn’t happen until 8th March! I was not expecting the call … assumed that so long had passed, it would surely be ok. I’m being referred to Queens Charlotte Hospital and all I’ve been told is I’ll need an op under general anaesthetic and it’ll happen quickly. What happens next? How do I know what stage I am? There are some pretty horrific stories of chemo radio etc and side effects. But the hospital who called (dermatologist at the local hospital) seemed pretty vague. soooo many questions! I mean, I’m an hour away from London, surely that means it’s bad right?? If I’m being referred there?? I’ve told my partner, my 19 year old son and my best friends and they’ve all said I need to keep positive which I’m intending on doing …. But I’d just like someone I can be honest with and right at this moment I’m bricking it! thank you for listening xxx

vulval,Question,suze99,Care of wound,"
Hi 
I had a biopsy done nearly a month ago and an abcess removed from same area on the vulva. It appeared to be healing ok as I was able to shower it daily and was mobilising as normal.
However nearly two weeks ago I found out my left hip is at risk of fracture due to a growth in the bone. I am currently waiting for surgery
I am.not allowed to weight bear so using crutches apart from trips to the loo I'm in bed all the time. Moving tentatively due to hip issues which means the sliding up and down the bed isn't helping vulva wound heal. I have been sitting on the loo and pouring water from jug over the area but struggling to dry it and can't keep it as clean as before. I can't see what the area looks like. 
I've asked for a district nurse to call but nearly a week and no sign.
Has anyone any advice about care of wound, best position to sit in. The wound is towards the back end so very awkward position. Have you had district nurse attend. 

Many thanks
Sue

vulval,Question,Cleo23,Call back,"
So back in march my partner had a scan and they seemed happy with it, i then had to fight to get a appointment e months after this to go theough the scan with consultant, which was clear and he was happy, all surgery had healed from December, and he said hey ill send u for another scan why not , and ill see u in another 4 months to check in.

Hi, I've posted a couple of times as I was awaiting a gynaecology appointment for a lesion I found. 

I went today, was there for seconds and he's said it is a sebaceous cyst.  I know he's an expert but I'm just not convinced- it doesn't look like any I can see online, it's flat and reddish like a bruise, it doesn't feel firm or fluid filled it's more like thickened skin and more surface level and not a moveable lump.  Is there anything I can do to get it looked at again- Im thinking it should have been a dermatologist rather than a gynaecologist, or am I overthinking and best to wait and see if it goes away?  
If I'd looked at sebaceous cysts first I'd have questioned it but I assumed it was right until I searched after.

vulval,Question,Sandrine K,Vulvar cancer with potential lung metastasis,"
Dear all,
We would be grateful for your advice as mom has been diagnosed with cancer.
It has been a month since she has started biopsies, and whereas initially they thought she has ovarian cancer, after having had a Hysteroscopy, Vaginoscopy and Colonoscopy, and it looks like it is Vulvar Cancer. She is also scheduled to have a CT guided lung biopsy next week, and they also want to check her kidneys as they saw some type of growth. 
She is undergoing severe pain and is not able to do anything, other than laying in bed, and whenever I take her to the doctors she suffers immensely.
Furthermore, she has been put on Oxycodon twice daily, alongside other pain medications. 
Has anyone gone through something similar and could share their experiences? Are lung biopsies painful, i.e.? We have so many questions and whereas the doctors are very skilled, they are not attending to the many questions we have and the uncertainly is making it harder for her.
I sincerely pray that she will be able to get some treatment that can prolong her life. They already mentioned that due to her other illnesses (Diabetes, blood pressure etc) they have already suggested light treatment vs. surgery.
I know that we still don't have a definite diagnosis, but I worry about everything taking so long.
I normally live 7 hours flight time away from her, but I am now with her till she starts her treatments, and she gets all the additional care she needs.
I would be grateful for any advice or recommendation that can make this time easier for us, even if a little as its all so hard.
Thanks so much!

I was told I would be in hospital for 4 weeks 2 of which I would have to lying on my side and a further 4/5 months off work.  I live on my own and have no family so I am terrified of how I would manage all this and I feel stupid as I feel the consultant is so abrupt and I never ask any questions.  I have so many other illnesses due to being immunosuppressed I honestly do not know whether to go through with it.  Has anyone been through anything like this and did you have a successful outcome.

vulval,Question,Sitara,Vulva Tumour,"
Hello Community, on the 3rd of October I was diagnosed with a vulva tumor via a CT scan, I have received my appointment and it’s not till the 17th of November to see the gynaecologist regarding staging. I have currently been treated for VIN3 in August whilst I also under went a hysterectomy. The results from the hysterectomy where clear with no abnormalities. I guess to quiet the mind which is very anxious at the moment, is six weeks a long time to wait for my next appointment, just interested in everyone’s experience and if there are options to speed up the appointment. I understand that the NHS are really busy and still playing catch up. Thank you

vulval,Question,Louise1990,Immunotherapy to treat lymph nodes?,"
Hi,
I've recently been diagnosed with vulva melanoma. My pet ct scans came back today and there is a risk that it has spread to my lymph nodes (more tests still to go). One area is quite deep in my pelvis apparently which would make surgery difficult so the team are suggesting immunotherapy first.
I thought surgery was my best bet at tackling this and my team dont have much experience in whether immunotherapy will work or not.
Does anyone have any experience of immunotherapy to treat melanoma that's spread to the lymph nodes?  Are there any other recommended treatments out there?

vulval,Question,CraftyJo,Newly diagnosed with cancer of the vulvar,"
3 years ago exactly I was diagnosed with anal cancer. Following my long and painful treatment of chemotherapy and radiotherapy I was left with radiation burns all around my back passage and what I thought my vagina. The ones on my vagina have grown bigger and much more painful.
On the 1st August, following an “unusual smear”in late July, I was seen at Southend hospital by a specialist gynaecologist assistant nurse. She was not happy with what she saw externally following an external examination and asked for the gynaecologist to come and see me. He inspected me, asked numerous questions, and as a result I was asked to come back the following day to see the cancer specialist gynaecologist due to my previous cancer history.
I did so, and as soon as he looked at me he diagnosed with vulva cancer. I had never heard of it before! He performed a colposcopy on me and did 3 different biopsies on me under local anaesthetic (boy that was more painful than childbirth!). He also told me there and then that I would have to have both sets of my my labia removed, the whole of my clitoris and nodes…I think he said lymph nodes but can’t be 100% sure. Last week I had a pelvic scan with dye put inside me and on the 30th I have MRI scan. 
He also said that the vulvar cancer is not related in anyway to my anal cancer. Has anyone else been treated for both types of cancer??
I am due to see the cancer specialist again next week sometime….still awaiting my appointment. The not knowing is killing me. Until I see him again he said he can’t specify if I will need even more surgery than he has already said I must have, as they obviously don’t know if it has spread further or not, or if I will need radiotherapy and chemotherapy too. I feel like I have a million and one unanswered questions in my head, but don’t know what the questions are, I’m not mentally prepared for all this, and this time I am so scared and angry (which I wasn’t last time around). I can’t stop thinking about it day and night and the pain is horrendous. I am on liquid morphine but that doesn’t seem to be helping either.
I know the only people that can give me the answers are the cancer specialist gynaecologist and the cancer support team once they receive all my results, but I would love to hear from any other ladies who have experienced vulvar cancer, their treatment and prognostic……good and bad. 
Thank you for taking the time to read and maybe reply to me. It is so appreciated

vulval,Question,Jo0911,White patch,"
Hi, 
My nurse practitioner has been reviewing an odd lesion on the inside of my labia majora. It is a flat white patch (about 6mm but not a clear cut border) with a grey middle and a purple mark just outside of it. She gave me steroid cream for a while but they made no difference. She referred me on a 2WW back in June and the hospital is backlogged and can’t see me until October (they agreed the urgency). I feel torn as to whether I should pursue this or not for a faster appointment at another hospital, or leave it to October. The lesion is not itchy or sore at all. It’s been there about a year. The only other thing of possible note is that I ask have a small hard nodule just inside the entrance to my vagina but I don’t have any symptoms from it. Thank you.

vulval,Question,Margeo,Waiting for results,"
I had a WLE for SCC nearly 4 weeks ago and although the wound is well healed I still haven't had a post op appointment to examine me, tell me the results from my surgery or give me a treatment plan.

vulval,Question,Anniefluer,Waiting on referal for strange new lump,"
Hi All,

It's been a few days and I have reading some stories from all you incredible people, diagnosed and undiagnosed.
Why am I here? Reassurance? To offload? To not feel alone? Oh boy my head is a mess right now.
Not been very well lately, been struggling at work, struggling with normal day to day activities, felt like i had an on going UTI, persistent itch and a feeling of fullness in the vagina. Been tested and no UTI. 
I check myself regular usually as I have a strong womens cancer in my family, mother cervical, sister womb. I have had abnormal smears myself also but have neglected testing since the pandemic. 
Was rather upset to hear from the doc that I haven't been suffering from UTI and not thrush which I keep treating regularly thinking the itch was down to that, with the new itch I have had constant blood stained mucus. I have had general warts at 18 which was treated in hospital as it was rather severe i am now 39 and no recurrence and have been positive for HPV. I also suffer from barholion cysts and I know that these lumps are not that.
The lumps I've found are strange with blood vessels running through them and are attached to the opening of the vagina and not inside, one is smooth and round the other part that is attached is bumpy with thick skin it's one mass but different, white in colour and size of a blueberry.
I wondered if anyone had experienced similar, benign or not and share their experiences.
I will try and ayteach pic in comments but was unsure of the rules.

vulval,Question,,Will dermovate treat Vin 2?,"
Hi. I've recently been diagnosed with Vin 2 following biopsies.
My symptoms of vulval itching and soreness have been going on for at least 10 years but most prominent in the past 4 years.  I've been treated with various steroid creams in the past 3 years and what I feel is fobbed off up until recently. (Think my age is a factor in this,  33)
Spoke to my consultant gynaecologist yesterday over the telephone and he is saying they will treat my Vin 2 with Dermovate. I've had this cre previously and although alleviates some of the soreness it never goes away even when using daily.
I don't feel a steroid cream is going to get rid of the Vin and wondered if I should be asking questions ?
My next appointment will be 21st January.

The thought of having to go through all this alone is freaking me out...to the point  I'm thinking of cancelling the surgery. 
Those of you that have been through this can I ask "" did the surgery cause disfigurement down there""? The abnormal cells are completely down 1 side of the vaginal wall and showing on the other but not to the same degree, also in the perineum.  How do they remove these aswell as a 1cm clear margin when the skin in these areas are extremely thin?? Sorry for the rant but I am so scared this time round. Any personnel experiences you would like to share would definitely help. Also any suggestions on dealing with the pain/ stitches afterwards.? Xx

vulval,Question,vulval cancer warrior,"Sentinel node biopsy on Wednesday- hints, tips, what to expect?","
Hello,

I had a wide local excision to remove VIN3 In feb. The post op biopsy come back as cancer  
I am due to have a sentinel node biopsy and another wide local excision on Wednesday. The wide local excision is just to widen my margins, so I feel I know what to expect with that as I’m hoping it will be no worse than last time. Im not sure what to expect with the sentinel node biopsy though.

vulval,Question,,High anxiety about odd symptoms,"
Hey there, I hope you're all doing well.
I'm posting this shortly before ringing my GP to make an appointment. I've been having some odd symptoms which have had me spinning into panic attacks (or just short of them) a lot recently. I haven't been tested or diagnosed with anything, but because my biggest fear is that it could be vulva/some other type of genital cancer, I'm posting here (I can't get the chat online function to show up, but that's a separate issue.)
In short, I've been feeling an odd recurring prickling sensation just short of my perineum, on the left. It's always in the same spot. I think there have been some skin changes around it as well, but I haven't had any pain or odd discharge. It just comes and goes. I think that the area surrounding my vulva has some slightly darker patches on it but I struggle to see properly when it comes to getting adequate lighting when doing self-checks. I only picked up on this after having some mild bleeding from my anal region (I'm pretty sure that's to do with something unrelated.)
There's a long smooth streak in that area, but I'm not sure why.
As I've said, I'm ringing my GP for a same-day appointment, but even so, I'm struggling with anxiety and panic. It could very well turn out to be nothing, but I might just need a bit of reassurance. I know the only one who can truly assess me properly is my GP and that many medical issues present similarly, but a bit of advice would be good.
Note: I'm well aware not to obsessively look up possible causes, because that will add to stress. I only looked up MacMillan because I've had positive experiences before with the community here and reading through posts here has helped me to feel calmer and more informed. But yeah, any chance I could just get a bit of encouragement and advice...?

vulval,Question,,VIN III: How slow is slow-growing?,"
Hi, I've been diagnosed with a recurrence of VIN III having had laser surgery for it in spring 2019. The re-diagnosis happened in June 2020 so - didn't get much time VIN free. Just over a year and it had reappeared.
I was and am gutted :( It seems utterly bizarre to have to go through all that again so soon - if it is soon. I've been waiting since last June, but COVID has meant sitting on a waiting list. I'm told VIN is apparently slow-growing, though I'm a bit uneasy just letting things run on. How long can it be left, before it progresses? Has anyone had experience of that?
I just want to have the op now, strange as it seems, so that it can be done and dealt with. And maybe next time I'll get more time VIN free. Live in hope!

was diagnosed with vulva squamous cell cancer 7cm 16 mm deep.  No lymph node involvement. Mum due to other co morbidities is not a candidate for surgery, the surgery would have been radical with removal of bowels. The only treatment option is radiotherapy and then they would not be able to do this at a curable dose.
Have proton beam therapy been used for vulva cancer and what is its success rate.  If mum could have withstood surgery and or full dose radiotherapy she would have a high chance of cure.
 I am willing to pay for the full course of proton beam therapy if need be ( although we would not be able to travel to Prague for this. Does anybody have any information that can help me.
Also how do you ladies manage your pain, mums pain is worse on movement and when she as a wee she is in agony at those points.

vulval,Question,RedLingua93,VIN3 Surgery,"
Hi all,
I was officially diagnosed with all 3 grades of VIN back in late March after having 6 biopsies in Feb. Think the VIN 3 is mostly on my inner labia as that's where I'm most ulcerated etc. 
I was referred to the local womens hospital to be under the gynaeoncologist. In April I saw his colleague - a specialist in vulval medicine - and she said as it's so widespread that Aldara was the only option right now. However, I saw the gynaeoncologist himself this Tuesday just gone and he wants to do a WLE to remove my inner labia on both sides and a patch near there on either side as he is not only thinks the Aldara cream will not work there but he is worried that there may be cancer given how ulcerated and indurated it is. 
I was in complete shock and didn't ask hardly any questions so I will be trying to get in touch with his secretary to see if I can speak over the phone with him to ask the questions I need. 
He said I will have two long scars and will look different but shouldn't be affected with sex or having children. 
Struggling to process it and its left with insomnia (currently still awake at 3am!). 
Needed to find somewhere with people who understood this horrible affliction so I don't feel so terribly alone. 
Thanks for reading!

vulval,Question,,Vin 3 surgery no stitches - wound advice needed please,"
Hi all, I have posted before about being diagnosed with vin and being booked in for surgery.
My surgery was last Monday.
When I saw the gynaecologist pre op I asked him what type of vin it was as I had not asked previously. 
He said vin 3. So moving on I had surgery to remove the affected area under epidural which was quite a large area on right side, near labia minora and fauchett (still learning these names) so more internal than external.
I wasn't stitched. I am advised it was some kind of ""skinning""?
So here I am almost a week later with an extremely raw and sore tuppence. 
I am seriously suffering 
The main problems I could do with advice on are the itching, the soreness (especially when I wee)
And the bleeding.
The bleeding was not bad at first, the kind of spotting you would expect from a deep graze.
Now it is worse, I am trying to go naked as much as poss to get air to it and help it dry but I can constantly feel blood and/or watery brown discharge running out.
I use a sitz bath to pee in sometimes to wear the pain and there is always lots of blood in it when I finish.
Because its raw I am not wanting to wear pads as I don't want them sticking to it.
Is the bleeding normal? I'm not even sure if it is from the wound or if it is from inside. My periods had stopped over 18 months ago (menopause ) I am 50 years old living in Leeds UK.
If anyone has any advice I would be very grateful.  Thanks for reading x

Because its raw I am not wanting to wear pads as I don't want them sticking to it.
Is the bleeding normal? I'm not even sure if it is from the wound or if it is from inside. My periods had stopped over 18 months ago (menopause ) I am 50 years old living in Leeds UK.
If anyone has any advice I would be very grateful.  Thanks for reading x

vulval,Question,,Vin 3 surgery no stitches - wound advice needed please,"
Hi all, I have posted before about being diagnosed with vin and being booked in for surgery.
My surgery was last Monday.
When I saw the gynaecologist pre op I asked him what type of vin it was as I had not asked previously. 
He said vin 3. So moving on I had surgery to remove the affected area under epidural which was quite a large area on right side, near labia minora and fauchett (still learning these names) so more internal than external.
I wasn't stitched. I am advised it was some kind of ""skinning""?
So here I am almost a week later with an extremely raw and sore tuppence. 
I am seriously suffering 
The main problems I could do with advice on are the itching, the soreness (especially when I wee)
And the bleeding.
The bleeding was not bad at first, the kind of spotting you would expect from a deep graze.

vulval,Question,,Lymphangitis/cellulitis,"
Hi I haven’t been on here for a while.
I was diognosed with vulva cancer July 2019 at the age of 47 I had a vulvectomy and also lymph node removal in my groin area. I then noticed a lump in my groin a couple of months later which turned out to be a cancerous lymph node so had that removed . I completed 25 seasons of radio therapy and chemo once a week for five weeks. In May 20 I developed lymphangitis which was so painful and made me feel so sick since then I have had it two more times so In 6 months I have had this 3 times !! I just wondered if anyone else has experienced this at all I had literally returned to work for 3 days after being off from treatment and furlough and now just recovering from Lymphangitis/ cellulitis again . It really gets me down as I was feeling amazing and so full of energy .

vulval,Question,FormerMember,Itching and soreness during periods???,"
Does anyone get itching and mild swelling of the vulva/fourchette area during their period? I do have dryness and a split in the fourchette area but after applying coconut oil it appears to be getting better. I completed my 16 week course of Aldara 2 weeks ago. Treated with Aldara following surgery WLE For Vin 3. I had positive margins. I had my check up with the vinegar test 3 weeks ago the consultant said it all looks ok. I’ve only just gone back to work so just started wearing tights again. Could it be that my vulva is trying to get back to a new normal?! I’m starting to freak out because I know I have HPV of that area. I’m wondering if it’s changing to VIN because I’ve stopped the Aldara? I’ll be grateful for any help or advice. X

I'm 3 months post bilateral groin sentinel node dissection and have just come out in a rash from one wound,  spreading across abdomen and out to hip  up towards underarm -it was hot to touch, plus I had beenverg unwell the day previous.   I sent photographs in to my gynae Oncology team who advised an infection (for which I am now taking antibiotics).
They were unable to answer why an infection would happen now.  Any advice out there?   I have only recently upped my exercise regime, having been on a couple of cycle rides and longer walks...

vulval,Question,,"Vulva caner, what did yours look like?","
Hello, 
I am 28 and in December I attended my GP in December with a painful lumpy section of my right Vulva that has been getting bigger, know it is getting bigger as it now sticks outside of the vaginal lips and rubs when I walk. 
It had been causing me pain on and off when washing in the shower for example for about a year but was getting more frequent. The GP gave me antibiotics and said to come back if it hasn't gone away. It hasn't.
In January there were no appointments at the docs and I was told they would call me, they never did.
Between taking my Uncle to this throat cancer radiotherapy and now Covid I haven’t been able to get another doctor app / opinion.
I will go to the doctor when able to hopefully soon however I wanted to ask what other peoples symptoms and what any limps they found looked like. I am more curious than freaking out.
My lump is like a scrunched up ball of skin that is the normal vulva colour but has a harder smaller very painful lump inside. That specific section gets very itchy sometimes but nowhere else. Ot also feels as if the skin in that area is thicker.
I have no STD or urinary track problems in the past (and have never had sex so I don’t know where I would have picked on up if that were the case)

Has anyone else had a similar lump in an area of the vulva that feels thicker but hasn’t changed colour?

vulval,Question,,Sentinel lymph node biopsy (groin),"
Hello,
I had a Sentinel lymph node biopsy 11 days ago and have now come up very swollen and bruised in the tummy, abdomen, inner thigh and labia areas (more on one side thant the other).  Due to the current situation I was asked to send photographs to my care team who have said is this is 'normal' and will subside.
I am lucky in that have no drains and dissolvable stitches, however am in a lot of discomfort/some pain - the slightest movement hurts.  Any advice out there on how to manage this?

Hi ladies. I was given the standard Amielle care dilators for use after brachytherapy. I find the ends aren't very rounded and the plastic is rigid so quite uncomfortable.

vaginal,Question,Lulu21,VAIN3,"
Hi this is my first post and am concerned about bleeding. I had a total hysterectomy in December 22 following abnormal smears and treatment. In June 23 I had a vault smear which came back abnormal. Then 2 small lumps were found in August which came back as VAIN3. In January I had another biopsy which came back as VAIN2. In March they found another area of concern but came back as cell changes consistent with HPV and the previous biopsy had not healed. Following weeks of pain and bleeding I spent 2 weeks trying to get another appointment. When I finally thought I had an appointment 6 weeks later it hadn’t been booked in but the gynaecologist agreed to see me. I had another vault smear which has come back high grade dyskaryosis. On 30 June I had a major vaginal bleed. It was so scary and I lost so much blood I thought I was going to bleed to death. The gynaecologists don’t know why it happened and can’t really find the place it came from as by the time they examined me it had stopped due to being given clotting medication. I am still waiting the biopsy results. Has anyone else had the bleeding? I’m really concerned it’s a sign of cancer .

vaginal,Question,,Worried sick,"
I am really struggling with symptoms and worried so much I cannot sleep.
i have been suffering brown bloody discharge and fresh red bleeding between periods, I suffer daily with lower back pain, lower abdominal pain and left leg pain. The pain is quite horrific even with painkillers. I suffer leg numbness and tingling and my toes go numb
Sex causes bleeding, and pain throughout the day after sex. I  have discovered what seem like growths inside and connected to my vaginal wall, they have a cell bumpy like surface and I would say they have got larger in the past month to about the size of a grape. 
Now the problem I have is I went to the doctor with the bleeding and pain I was given a clear smear test just of the cervix. My question is “ would a vaginal cancer be missed by a cervical smear” I did not know I had the masses inside my vagina at the time of the smear about 7 months ago, however I have since been back to the doctor but she just said they are due to me getting older (36) and didn’t even examine me. She then referred me to physio for my back 

any advice would be so very gratefully appreciated. Thank you

vaginal,Question,Cdl04,Vaginal cancer,"





Hi, I'm 44 and I live in Yorkshire I have 2 children 18 and 11 and have been married for 20 years this year.
In January I found a hard lump on the left side of my vagina sex was painful and I would bleed very time. I had previously been to doctors with a few symptoms like being very dry and bleeding after sex but it was all put down as being perimenopause. Then when I found this hard red lump I went back and the doctors.
The doctors had no idea so they referred me to Gynaecology on a fast-track pathway.
I was then sent for a colonoscopy where they took swabs and a biopsy.
Then I got a call the next morning That they wanted me back that day.
 I saw a surgeon who didn't like the look of it so decided to remove it.
They thought at first that it was a Bartholins Cyst that had already ruptured but hadn't naturally gone.
On examination, she found another cyst behind the old one removed both and sent both away to be analysed.
This then came back as cancer which was in February since then I have had an MRI chest X-ray 2colopcopys and a PET-CT scan.
I have been told it is in my lymph nodes but I don't know how many I have no idea what stage I have no idea on anything I have cancer and that's it. 
I know the tests take time and the waiting is the worst and the not knowing but I found it in January and next week April and have no dates for anything.
I'm terrified, annoyed, upset that I'm not been told anything.

vaginal,Question,AEW66,"Large tumour, optimistic outlook! Radical treatment plan?","
I have a large stage 2 vaginal tumour 6x4cm, localised with no spread. It’s on the posterior vaginal wall and is very painful. Weeks ago I had myself dead and buried looking on Google!
Diagnosed 11th Jan and got my treatment plan now, to start week commencing 19th Feb.
Doctor said they’re doing ‘radical chemoradiotherapy’, over 7 weeks. Radiotherapy every day except weekends and on one of those days I’ll also have chemo Cistplatin via IV. 
Anyone know why this is radical? I can only assume that normally these treatments are given separately over a longer period of time?

vaginal,Question,AEW66,"Large tumour, optimistic outlook! Radical treatment plan?","
I have a large stage 2 vaginal tumour 6x4cm, localised with no spread. It’s on the posterior vaginal wall and is very painful. Weeks ago I had myself dead and buried looking on Google!
Diagnosed 11th Jan and got my treatment plan now, to start week commencing 19th Feb.
Doctor said they’re doing ‘radical chemoradiotherapy’, over 7 weeks. Radiotherapy every day except weekends and on one of those days I’ll also have chemo Cistplatin via IV. 
Anyone know why this is radical? I can only assume that normally these treatments are given separately over a longer period of time?

vaginal,Question,Ctpink,Chemo,"
I am stage 3 & have just had 2 weeks of radiotherapy & 2 chemo sessions. The chemo has totally knocked me off my feet & I have every side effect going.
On Friday I collapsed & my best friend had to come over & clean me. I was like a helpless baby. The diarrhoea is sometimes uncontrollable & hits me out of nowhere.
I have lost so much weight the radiotherapy needs remapping. I hate feeling so helpless.
Did anyone else have a problem with chemo?

vaginal,Question,Dorset Girl,Worried about planning scan,"
Hi 
I have a CT planning scan on Friday in preparation for external radiotherapy. Told to allow 3-4 hours for the appointment, drink 4 pints of water daily and avoid leafy veg. 
A big worry for me is the loss of dignity and what feels like the invasion of the most intimate parts of my body during examinations etc. I can cope with a fair bit of discomfort and pain but it's all the poking about in places that I'd rather weren't exposed to the world that gets to me 
I know the staff are sensitive to this and have seen it all before but I really do hate it ! 

What we're your experiences like and any suggestions about how to deal with it?

vaginal,Question,Dorset Girl,Catch up,"
Hi Everyone 
I hope Christmas was OK for you under such difficult circumstances. Personally I'm relieved it's over  
I hope you don't mind if I give you a quick update and ask how everybody is doing? I find it helpful to talk with others in a similar position. 
My diagnosis of Stage 3 vaginal cancer was confirmed on 12th December following a PET scan. I also had a biopsy taken on that day and an MRI a few days later but I don't have the results yet. I've had 2 rounds of chemo so far - paclitaxel and carboplatin. Side effects have been very mild so far thank goodness. I wonder if they get worse as treatment processes? 
I'll be having chemo radiation after 6 rounds of chemo and then brachytherapy which is what I'm most worried about.  
I don't really know what this entails , is it done under local or general anaesthetic, do I stay in, what are the side effects?? So many questions pop into my head usually around 3am 
Anyway , thanks for reading. All replies gratefully received and  to you all. 
I'm off to the beach for some Vitamin Sea while I'm on a steroid high

Hi all, I am very concerned about some symptoms I have and have employed Doctor Google  I have also seen my GP almost a year ago who didn't see anything urgent but referred me for a routine gynaecology appt but the huge waiting lists mean I haven't seen anyone. My only real symptom is incessant vaginal itching and some mild discomfort during sex. The vaginal itching went on for a very long time before I finally went to the doctor. I believed it was lichen sclerosis but steroid cream didn't have any effective. I also now have anal itching which is leading to a panic about anal and vaginal cancers. Why do our brains do that to us?! Especially at 3am!! I have another appt with my GP on 2nd Jan where I am hoping she will make the referral urgent. Does anyone know of any conditions that might have these kind of symptoms? I am concerned I guess because the symptoms have been with me for so long that if it is cancer, that will not be good. I am 43 with 3 boys

Hi I was wondering if anyone has any experience with radiation to the vagina that they wouldn't mind sharing with what to expect?
I started off with vulval melanoma which has now tracked up my vagina and I have a couple of tumours which I'll be having radiotherapy for in a couple of weeks along side my 3 weekly immunotherapy. My oncologist has warned me I'm likely to have a number of side effects, blistering etc and also mentioned something about applying a wax layer for the radiation sessions but I zoned out a little at this point with all the information to take in. 
Best case I'll have 5 sessions every other day, worst case 5 days a week for 4 weeks depending what my next set of scans show, which always makes me nervous!

vaginal,Question,Crazy Daisy,Vaginal cancer diagnosis and treatment,"
Hi all, I'm new here and have recently received a vaginal cancer diagnosis. I have a treatment planning session today and already feel nervous. I've opted for brachytherapy and my oncologist told me￼'ll have to lay flat for 20 something hours. Any coping would be welcome ￼

vaginal,Question,Fieryfifer,Vaginal melanoma,"
Hey there. I am looking for some advice as I dont know where to turn. I am 58 years old.This time last year I found a black lump covering my clitoris when showering. GP appointment referred me to gynae for check. Biopsy arranged. 2 biopsies taken (infection and antibiotics needed) then phone call 2 weeks later ""its not good news, is cancer."" Chemo, radiation and treatment discussed briefly. 20 minutes later another phonecall to say ""better news...is still cancer but can possibly be treated by surgery alone"" Specialist cancer nurse arranged. Told to wait for appointment with surgeon through post. 1st app with surgeon, looked and said I can take that away today, but wasnt able to so booked for local anaesthetic removal 2 weeks later. An hour and half in stirrups and couldnt get it all away with margins. Booked me in for general 2 weeks later to open and remove remaining melanoma. Arrived 8am as instructed. Put in a side room till 3pm. No bed for me. Changed for theatre in a store room. Taken to theatre and over an hour again with a spinal block as no bed for recovery from general. On coming round was told by surgeon had to dig a lot deeper than thought and couldnt save much clitoris. Had to sort myself and get home 2 hours later, no support or conversations about what had occurred or aftercare. 3 month check clear. 6 month check I had found another lump, labial fold. Same surgeon told me just a blood clot probably but organised another biopsy. Waited for date, went in to hosp, different surgeon. Looked and said had this grown in past 4 weeks? I will just take it all away to be checked instead of just a biopsy. Results given by original surgeon over phone again, told that cancerous cells had formed and would have developed into another melanoma if hadnt been removed. She was concerned at the rate of recurrance so would pass my case to dermatology as she was gynae, it was in my system and they could do a full body check. She would still see me every 3 months. So. Now when I chased up for my dermatology appointment with my GP, the surgeon rang me and said to me""its not cancer. You havnt had cancer. I will ask dermatology to see you but it may not be before our next 3 month check (31st Aug) and maybe not even before the end of the year, if you see them before your next 3 month check with me then you dont need to see me.  I was spoken to like a scolded overimaginative child. Yesterday. My life has changed dramatically this past year. I have no clitoris. I have been cut open and sown up 4 times. I have now been told it wasnt, nor is it now, cancer. I have NO idea how to deal with all this. Could non surgery treatment have been an option? Melanoma and cancerous cells NOT cancer? I am distraught. Lost. Numb, and VERY angry. Please advise if anyone has any thoughts how I can deal with this. Thank you.

vaginal,Question,,I've just been referred,"
Hello,
I went to the doctor's on NYE after discovering a growth of some sort within my vagina. The doctor checked and said I have multiple growths of various sizes. I have also been having a bit of spotting for a few days as well as a horrible pressure feeling, like I'm having a prolapse or something. The doctor said definitely no prolapse and not cysts. He's referred me to gynaecologist for biopsy etc. I'm absolutely terrified. I lost my husband to brain cancer three year ago and I have a ten year old and a three year old who need me so much. I'm only 31 and I just don't know how I've managed to be the unluckiest person in the world. My daughter is a twice cancer survivor (clear for 6 years now) and my little boy has autism. I really don't have the energy for much more.... 
My question I guess is, what can I expect from this point onwards towards a diagnosis. I feel like I'm totally on my own with the journey :(

womb,Question,Sparky55,Biopsy results at last but now I am confused,"
I know there are lots of us waiting for biopsy results currently and the wait is agonising, I really do hope everyone gets results very soon. At last on day 13, I have mine and fortunately I've been told 'nothing abnormal' was found. I feel very lucky but it raises so many questions for me as I am booked in for hysterectomy on Monday and it is going ahead!
I have tried to speak to my consultant through his secretary but not really getting answers so I am wondering if there are any experts on this out there. In fact his secretary is very short with me and not at all helpful and makes me feel awkward when ever I ask a question. Literally one word answers. My consultant is much the same tbh and I get very little opportunity to ask any questions and have no meeting with him ahead of surgery on Monday. I was even a bit put out that one of his letters said 'removal of ovaries to be discussed on the day of surgery'. I felt it would be right to discuss it before the day of surgery, but am I being overly sensitive?
Here is my timeline to explain why I am now confused:

Heavy bleeding for 6 weeks (pre-menopause age 47), family history of womb cancer (mother)
First Ultrasound showed 47mm thickening and multiple small fibroids - confirmed in letter by consultant and he said he was very concerned about this
Hysteroscopy, biopsy taken, polyps found - confirmed in letter and summary of condition by consultant but no mention of fibroids in this letter - so are fibroids actually polyps or do I have both? I need to clarify this on Monday and I know I can't get that answer here.
Automatically booked in for Hysterectomy when biopsy taken, as not suitable for IUD. Consultant explained Hyperplasia may come back as simple, complex, atypical etc.
Biopsy result 'nothing abnormal' - one line letter from consultant no further details
I email secretary asking for the type of hyperplasia found. I expect this to be 'simple' therefore?
She responds saying 'no hyperplasia was found in the sample'.

So my questions are:

How can it be no hyperplasia in the biopsy sample, if I have previously been told it is 47mm? Or am I getting confused about womb thickening and hyperplasia and they are not the same thing?
Does this mean the 47mm thickening is actually elsewhere and the biopsy might not have been from the 'right' place? Could this therefore be a false negative?
Will my womb go off for a post-op histology to ensure nothing abnormal, even if no cancer was found at initial biopsy?
Is he likely recommending hysterectomy as polyps, fibroids and thickening and family history are likely to lead to a future cancer diagnosis?

I understand a lot of this needs to be answered by my consultant, so I really do want to actually see him before surgery and desperately hoping I do! I feel a bit lost tbh and wondering if my hysterectomy is still necessary, even if I can't have an IUD. I am fine if it is, but would a D&C and polyps removal not be more appropriate?  Or will it all grow back?
I am sorry to ask these questions when effectively I have been given the all clear and there are many who have confirmed diagnosis. But I can't speak to my consultant and Google isn't giving me the answers!

I felt it would be right to discuss it before the day of surgery, but am I being overly sensitive?
Here is my timeline to explain why I am now confused:

Heavy bleeding for 6 weeks (pre-menopause age 47), family history of womb cancer (mother)
First Ultrasound showed 47mm thickening and multiple small fibroids - confirmed in letter by consultant and he said he was very concerned about this
Hysteroscopy, biopsy taken, polyps found - confirmed in letter and summary of condition by consultant but no mention of fibroids in this letter - so are fibroids actually polyps or do I have both? I need to clarify this on Monday and I know I can't get that answer here.
Automatically booked in for Hysterectomy when biopsy taken, as not suitable for IUD. Consultant explained Hyperplasia may come back as simple, complex, atypical etc.
Biopsy result 'nothing abnormal' - one line letter from consultant no further details
I email secretary asking for the type of hyperplasia found. I expect this to be 'simple' therefore?
She responds saying 'no hyperplasia was found in the sample'.

So my questions are:

How can it be no hyperplasia in the biopsy sample, if I have previously been told it is 47mm? Or am I getting confused about womb thickening and hyperplasia and they are not the same thing?
Does this mean the 47mm thickening is actually elsewhere and the biopsy might not have been from the 'right' place? Could this therefore be a false negative?
Will my womb go off for a post-op histology to ensure nothing abnormal, even if no cancer was found at initial biopsy?
Is he likely recommending hysterectomy as polyps, fibroids and thickening and family history are likely to lead to a future cancer diagnosis?

I understand a lot of this needs to be answered by my consultant, so I really do want to actually see him before surgery and desperately hoping I do! I feel a bit lost tbh and wondering if my hysterectomy is still necessary, even if I can't have an IUD. I am fine if it is, but would a D&C and polyps removal not be more appropriate?  Or will it all grow back?
I am sorry to ask these questions when effectively I have been given the all clear and there are many who have confirmed diagnosis. But I can't speak to my consultant and Google isn't giving me the answers!

womb,Question,Katharinelk,Cramping pain while waiting for biopsy,"
Hello ladies, 
I am 59 and postmenopausal. A week ago I started to have occasional spotting, light pink to reddish brown in color. A TV ultrasound 2 days ago revealed my endometrium is thickened at 17mm. I have many risk factors for endometrial cancer (overweight, no children, family history) 
An endometrial biopsy was recommended, however my appointment is not for another 3 weeks. They do not seem concerned about the delay, which is frustrating to me. 
In the meantime, I have developed cramping pelvic pain - just like the bad menstrual cramps I used to get - in addition to a feeling of pressure in my pelvis, along with diarrhea. I have also been losing weight over the past few months. (a silver lining? Pun intended ) 
On top of this, as a former smoker, I had a screening lung CT a month ago which revealed 3 nodules in my lungs. At the time, I was told they would rescan in a year to monitor. But now I am concerned about possible metastasis from endometrial cancer. 
I have read that my symptoms don't necessarily mean I have cancer, but my gut is telling me otherwise (I will admit to consulting with Dr. Google, who, as we all know, doesn't always have the best bedside manner) 
My question to all of you lovely ladies is two part. 
1. If it's not cancer, what would explain both bleeding and cramping pain? 
2. Have any of you had, or do you know of anyone who has had, both bleeding and cramping + other symptoms, along with a significantly thickened endometrium, had it not turn out to be cancer? 
Thanks so much for reading my long post. I'm just scared, and I'm so glad to have found thus forum. I have read many of your stories, and I am thoroughly impressed by the strength, and the kindness, of each of you. ️

womb,Question,Waidh,Facing my demon - hair loss,"
So surgery out of the way, on the home straight with chemoradiotherapy ( second lot of cisplatin done yesterday) and the demon that I have been facing for some time is coming up. I will be starting carboplatin and paclitaxel at end of March, and with it the dreaded hair loss.  So I know there are other worse side effects, but this is the one getting to me.
I have new wig, it looks like me when I try it on, I have 3 other head coverings in preparation to see how these would look.  Yesterday when having chemo one of the nurses mentioned scalp cooling ..the first time anyone at hospital has mentioned this, despite me having several conversations about hair loss, so I am now seriously considering this. And read Jane’s blog on this last night. I can relate to your reasons Jane, for me it isn’t about vanity, it’s just at the moment you wouldn’t know I was having cancer treatment, I look like me, and this gives me the strength I need to get through this.
i have a few questions
1) for those using wigs, how comfortable did you feel? Did you use them a lot of the time?, any tips for their use?
2) if you tried scalp cooling, what helped you to get through it? I’ve read the first 20 mins are the worst, but how is it after this? Are you able to use small ear phones so you can play music? Any other advice?
Thank you

2) if you tried scalp cooling, what helped you to get through it? I’ve read the first 20 mins are the worst, but how is it after this? Are you able to use small ear phones so you can play music? Any other advice?
Thank you

womb,Question,Waidh,Facing my demon - hair loss,"
So surgery out of the way, on the home straight with chemoradiotherapy ( second lot of cisplatin done yesterday) and the demon that I have been facing for some time is coming up. I will be starting carboplatin and paclitaxel at end of March, and with it the dreaded hair loss.  So I know there are other worse side effects, but this is the one getting to me.
I have new wig, it looks like me when I try it on, I have 3 other head coverings in preparation to see how these would look.  Yesterday when having chemo one of the nurses mentioned scalp cooling ..the first time anyone at hospital has mentioned this, despite me having several conversations about hair loss, so I am now seriously considering this. And read Jane’s blog on this last night. I can relate to your reasons Jane, for me it isn’t about vanity, it’s just at the moment you wouldn’t know I was having cancer treatment, I look like me, and this gives me the strength I need to get through this.

womb,Question,Lucem,Thickened womb lining,"
Hi all. I don't even know where to start, can't quite believe iv found myself on this path again. I was diagnosed with BC back in Nov 2021 had chemo and mastectomy etc and was put on zoladex injections for 19months, finished them a year ago and have been on tamoxifen ever since. Iv not had periods since starting chemo as that stopped them and then obviously the zoladex kept them at bay. 3 weeks ago I had a slight bleed, it was minor and was gone as quick as it came. Went to drs and got referred on 2ww. Had an vaginal ultrasound and have been for the results today. They said scan shows extremely thick lining 20mm!!!! And tht i have cysts on my ovaries (he said the 2 things are not connected) I have to go back next week for a biopsy and a camera to look closer at the womb. I am absolutely terrified beyond words. That lining seems so thick and I can't think of anything but the worst. Any words of wisdom would be appreciated xxx

womb,Question,Sparky55,Not sure what to do about ovaries,"
Hi all you lovely people
I just got a provisional date for surgery come through quite unexpectedly as I am still waiting biopsy results. It's in just 12 days!
The plan was always a hysterectomy for multiple polyps, severe thickening of the lining at 47mm and fibroids. I have been told if it does come back with anything cancerous now then it will be delayed slightly for MRI, etc. I have a family history of uterine cancer and at age 47 this seems the best option for me as IUD not suitable.
I have not been through the menopause yet but had been on HRT for a few mild symptoms. My consultant has said as long at the histology comes back okay I can chose whether to keep my ovaries if I want to. I can't work out to what to do. I know they continue to secrete hormones at a low level for the rest of our lives, which can be beneficial for bones, etc. but I don't know whether keeping them is a risk for future cancer? Obviously if my biopsies come back with anything it will be out of my hands.
I am apprehensive about a sudden surgical menopause, especially when I've had no discussions with anyone about whether HRT will be an option post-op. But I also don't want to take unnecessary risks. I am also wondering if I could get my ovaries privately scanned regularly going forward if I keep them. has anyone had to make this kind of decision?

womb,Question,SnoopyGal,Chemo or Hormone Therapy?,"
Hi, I was diagnosed with recurrent womb cancer last Tuesday (previously diagnosed with stage 1a in 2023 and had a hysterectomy and no other treatment). On Thursday I went back to discuss treatment. First of all Chemo was mentioned as the only option and we spent an hour discussing it. The Registrar hadn't known it was stage 1a and went out to discuss with a consultant. They came back and said Hormone Therapy (HT) was also an option. I think I was still in shock about the news and hadn't really heard about HT. Has anyone any advice as to which is preferable to have?

womb,Question,Sparky55,Just feeling super scared about it all,"
Hi, I'm really scared and just wanted to see if anyone has had any similar experiences. I'm 47 and been on the mini pill and virtually period free for 5 years. In early December I started bleeding and it got so heavy I couldn't leave the house and had to go sick at work. I was using maternity pads and changing every hour and also sleeping on a towel. I started to lose blood clots which got progressively bigger, but what concerned me more were pieces of what I can only describe as tissue the size of a small finger. It would pass out when I sat on the toilet. I finally booked an appointment in mid January through my private healthcare provider as I am lucky to have that through my work. I was still bleeding heavily at this point. I wondered if it was caused by menopause although I am ready taking HRT. I took photos of the tissue I was passing but my consultant has not really commented. I'm not in pain but uncomfortable and 'full', especially when I cough.
I was immediately put on on tranexamic acid and northistrone 3 times a day which stopped the bleeding and sent for an ultrasound. This showed 3 smallish fibroids but of more concern is my endometrial lining which is 47mm (likely adenomyosis) and my consultant seems concerned about this. My mother had stage 3 uterus cancer when she was 60 and a radical hysterectomy.
The plan is for me to have a hysteroscopy this week and a biopsy. I stupidly never thought it could be cancer, just fibroids, but my consultant says he is not so worried about those. A hysterectomy is planned as I cannot stay on northiestrone indefinitely and am not suitable for an IUD. Right now I am freaking about the hysteroscopy, as I have researched and I know it can be very painful. No pain relief has been offered.The trouble is all that is on Google mainly are horror stories which add to my anxiety. 
But my bigger worry is what is going on. I've been feeling super run down for weeks and just now recovering from a cold I got at Christmas that turned into a chest infection. On top of that my dog died unexpectedly last week and I had had her for 15 years. The grief is making me feel awful and I'm trying to stay calm but really struggling.
I rang my healthcare provider to see if they would pay for my planned hysterectomy and they were a bit on the fence if not cancer, citing that it might be deemed a chronic condition and not acute and therefore not covered, and I needed to try 'alternatives' first. My consultant has said I definitely need treatment and if they won't pay he would treat me under the NHS, so I know I am fortunate.  Sorry for the off-load, I just want to know if anyone else has had similar symptoms as I can't seem to find out if my 47mm thickness and tissue passing is likely to be symptomatic of cancer. I just want to prepare myself.

I took photos of the tissue I was passing but my consultant has not really commented. I'm not in pain but uncomfortable and 'full', especially when I cough.
I was immediately put on on tranexamic acid and northistrone 3 times a day which stopped the bleeding and sent for an ultrasound. This showed 3 smallish fibroids but of more concern is my endometrial lining which is 47mm (likely adenomyosis) and my consultant seems concerned about this. My mother had stage 3 uterus cancer when she was 60 and a radical hysterectomy.
The plan is for me to have a hysteroscopy this week and a biopsy. I stupidly never thought it could be cancer, just fibroids, but my consultant says he is not so worried about those. A hysterectomy is planned as I cannot stay on northiestrone indefinitely and am not suitable for an IUD. Right now I am freaking about the hysteroscopy, as I have researched and I know it can be very painful. No pain relief has been offered.The trouble is all that is on Google mainly are horror stories which add to my anxiety. 
But my bigger worry is what is going on. I've been feeling super run down for weeks and just now recovering from a cold I got at Christmas that turned into a chest infection. On top of that my dog died unexpectedly last week and I had had her for 15 years. The grief is making me feel awful and I'm trying to stay calm but really struggling.
I rang my healthcare provider to see if they would pay for my planned hysterectomy and they were a bit on the fence if not cancer, citing that it might be deemed a chronic condition and not acute and therefore not covered, and I needed to try 'alternatives' first. My consultant has said I definitely need treatment and if they won't pay he would treat me under the NHS, so I know I am fortunate.  Sorry for the off-load, I just want to know if anyone else has had similar symptoms as I can't seem to find out if my 47mm thickness and tissue passing is likely to be symptomatic of cancer. I just want to prepare myself.

Hi, I'm really scared and just wanted to see if anyone has had any similar experiences. I'm 47 and been on the mini pill and virtually period free for 5 years.

womb,Question,Angiaqua,chemo side effects possibly?,"
Hi, I had my first chemo session on Wednesday 8th of January. I ended up having a PICC line as my veins were too wonky to let a canula in. I felt fine on the day and the day after. I could not poop for 48 hours and when I did finally poop yesterday (Friday) it was difficult, and left me with stomach and lower back pain. Now I am not usually anywhere near constipated so most likely down to chemo or antisickness tablets. I drink over 3 litres of water a day and eat low salt and high fibre diet. I have woken up this morning and had another constipated poop (sorry if tmi). However I am now in pain all over my body, head down to my toes, in all joints and muscles. Temperature in normal range. Pain is making me very tired and a little shaky. Now the cancer treatment record book lists side effects and when to call them up. Pain is mentioned briefly as a 24 hour thing. Do I count that from the stomach/lower back pain from yesterday or waking up today in pain all over? I hope its ok to ask this? Thank you in advance for any responses.

I have been on it at 200mg for just over two weeks. On Tuesday I started to have cramping, pelvic pain . This continued on Wednesday. On Thursday afternoon I had acute pelvic pain, cramping and a lot of pressure along with a mild bleeding. It took to 1am for it to fully subside. 
I spoke to the CNS and she said this can happen with this meditation. Hopefully it will settle down. 
The same thing has happened today.

womb,Question,heathers,MRI and urgent referral,"
I recently had an MRI for a suspected IBD. Those results came back fine, but I received urgent referrals for an ultrasound and hysteroscopy for a 'lesion' in my uterus. Now, I've had fibroids before and realise it's probably this, but this was an MRI and I'm worried that if they can't see what's what clearly on there, they're never going to.
Also, I'm 51 and thought I was going through menopause - a gradual winding down then no periods from last February until December, when I suddenly absolutely haemorrhaged and destroyed a good carpet! Since then, two heavy bleeds, pink discharge and soreness. So, it could be a fibroid but why didn't they just say so on the report? How much can they see on an MRI (considering they were focusing on the bowel)? Should I stop panicking?

However the didn't happen due to my CT scan results not being available/sent for my case to be discussed. 
I understand the need to have everything to review together. I'm angry with myself for fixing the date in my head that this would be it and a little disappointed that I was led to believe this might be the case too. 
However hopefully this Monday morning my case will be reviewed and I should hear on Monday afternoon. 
I feel like I'm living two different lives at the moment and I find it hard to try and not let the waiting or the diagnosis to be the only focus.  
I'm feeling lonely in this at times althrough I have amazing family and friends supporting me. I fill guilty that I feel alone. Anyone else feel/experience this. 
Also I've found it hard that when people find out they start to cry and I've not cried about it yet. Again makes me feel guilty and selfish to even question this. Has anyone experienced this too.

womb,Question,IdahoGal,Endometrial Cancer Stage 3C1 Grade 1 -,"
Hi All,

Well here I am.   Starting spotting late September while on a long road trip.  Got back a couple days end of October immediately went to Primary Dr November 1st . Had Pap, she scheduled a ultrasound vaginal and external about a week later.    Both came back fine no masses showing except endo lining at 11mm..  
sent to Oncologist..Mid November he did a biopsy came back Nov 21.. with Endometrial cancer Grade 1  referred to gyno/oncologists. Met surgeon Dec 12th.. Surgery scheduled Jan 9th.  (Surgeon stated of you caught this so early all pre test look great some wait for 6 months or more after spotting)
December full body CT scan with contract..  Uterus looked fine except 11mm lining, no metastasis shown anywhere or enlarged lymph nodes.
surgery Jan 9th.   Pathology came back two weeks later..  BOOM..   Hardly any myometrial involvement less then 50%  (4mm) , But spread to cervix very light involvement here's the kicker...  4 sentinel lymph nodes removed and ALL 4 contained cancer.     Its like the cancer virtually skimmed across the uterus and headed right for the lymph nodes.  Which makes me Stage 3C1.  ( I am just going to treat it like Stage 3C2 since my surgeon did not remove the Para-Aortic lymph node.  Mizell just assume it went there as well. 
So much for slow growing Grade 1 endometrioid cancer. none of it even showed up in any CT scans, ultrasounds or physical examinations.  Lymph nodes not enlarged or anything. 
Anyone else had this happen where it just came out of the blue to a higher stage than you or any medical surgeon, doctors, radiologist etc thought?
Should I just assume the full body CT scan pre-surgery I had was incorrect as well stating no metastasis that's what I feel like at this point  
So come Tuesday will meet with my new oncologist to go over treatment plan.  Already assuming will be 6 cycles of chemo 3 weeks apart and then followed by radiation.  I initially was freaked out about this and now.. I just want it over and done with.  I guess the good thing is I am not P53 Wild, 
I ordered a couple wigs in preparation and also cold cap and mitts for hands and feet. 
Any survival stories out their for Stage 3C2?  To boost my fears that all is not lost. 
Thank you.. 
Laurie

womb,Question,nitnat,What on earth is falling out of me?!,"
Evening all, I’m new here and I do apologise for the length of my first post. You are all so incredibly helpful and knowledgeable, I’m hoping you may be able to help me.
I’m in for a hysteroscopy next week with suspected endometrial cancer. I’m late perimenopause, early forties and estrogen dominant (I’ve had a progesterone deficiency for a long time). My most notable symptoms are tons of cervical mucus (clear discharge) daily with no smell/occasionally pink, increasing pelvic/back/vaginal pain and a 50mm endometrial lining (seen in my recent ultrasound). 
When going to the bathroom in recent weeks, I would occasionally see an unusual transparent pink, rope like tissue/discharge - floating in the bowl after I’m done going for a pee. This strange discharge/rope texture, is never in my underwear/on a pad, only in the bowl of the toilet. This morning, my small dog jumped onto me, bang smack into my uterus and I was in insane pain for a couple of hours. Immediately after the incident I had a heavy bleed, whereas I’m mostly dribbling/spotting blood in recent weeks.
I went to the bathroom for a pee and towel change a couple of hours later and there was a much larger amount of this strange transparent, pink ‘rope’. It was twirling and floating and behaving very differently to the rest of the blood/pink clear discharge that had sunk to the bottom of the bowl. I was so taken aback, I took a video!
I have endometriosis and PCOS, so I’m no stranger to extreme blood loss and clots, this rope like tissue however is very different. I’ve been researching and watching far more videos than I should during all the waiting, including hysteroscopies in women with endometrial cancer. I noticed with a lot of the women with womb cancer in these videos, their uterus contained an almost soft coral like texture, with transparent pink-vascular ropes attached to their lining.
This is exactly what the texture is like that I saw in the bowl today and previously (to a lesser degree). Is this even possible, has it happened to any of you?! Could the knock from my dog have dislodged a small amount of cancerous lining?! 
I would be ever so grateful for any help, thank you

Hi there, 
Following hysteroscopy i received the diagnosis on Tuesday by phone and am waiting for when my consultant appointment is. Nurse practitioner said I’ll be having a hysterectomy.I’ve been told it’s endometrial cancer, grade 1 and have already had an MRI. I naively thought I’d be in next week for the op but they said more like 3-4 wks. Is that right? Am I just impatient? 
im hoping i actually have ovaries etc out as well because i have cysts that were suspect at one point too. I have a lot of fibroids so am wondering if that will mean i will need to be opened up rather than laproscopic or vaginally - how do they decide what method to use? 
im also worried that the nhs has so many pressures particularly in gynae and worried this may affect spread. 
It’s great to have a forum for support xx

womb,Question,Su2,Recently diagnosed endometrial cancer grade 1,"
HI.
I attending my raid access appointment with my consultant yesterday after having a womb polyp and biopsy taken last Tuesday.
I have endometrial cancer (cancer of the womb). That feelings wierd to type. Its grade 1 which is good but we don't know what stage. I will start progesterone medication today. I will have a CT scan on Thursday to see if it's just located in the womb or else where. A week on Monday I will hear from the Cancer Centre hospital as to their secondary test of the biopsy they took last week. I have to have a full hysterectomy but to have surgery I need to loss weight fast as at present it would not be safe. So I am waiting for a multidisciplinary team to contact me who work with patients that need to loss weight fast for surgery. Once I have had surgery and depending on what they find I may then need radiation therapy. I have also been told that due to having PCOS I should not be eating carbohydrates. So we are having to rethink my whole food intake too.
I'm so angry about the weight because I've been trying to hard and finical hitting us hard. The information about PCOS is so confusing with. Anyway that's a different form. But sadly having PCOS has a higher risk factor to developing this type of cancer. 
Anxiety has kicked in today feeing nauseous and tension head mostly like due to the million and one things going around my head. Doing some diamond art/crafts to distracted myself, sort of working. 
Has anyone else been on this journey including having to lose weight to get BMI down?

I have been recently diagnosed with endometrial cancer stage 1 grade 1. It was a complete shock obviously, but not just for me, even the doctor was surprised given my young age.
As I do not have kids yet and wish to preserve the fertility, the doctor is taking preservative approach. I was started on Provera 400mg in December but since last week I started bleeding again. So doctor increased the dose to 600mg. They will also be inserting mirena coil in February.
Please can I get some guidance as to what I can do from my end. Also, is some what bleeding normal even while taking Provera?
So many questions pops up in head all the time and anxiety is very real. I know it is good it has been diagnosed at such an early stage but still the doctor said that the chances of medicines to work is 50%.

womb,Question,Sloop,What stage am I ?,"
Hi , 
I am from Essex originally but currently living and being treated for high grade 3 endemetriol cancer in Singapore.
After having a total hysterectomy (which I’m recovering from brilliantly)  my stage on the histology said  2b - no cancer found anywhere else, 1.8 cm tumour and less than 50% into the lining. 
However when I went to the radio therapist he said I was more like a 1a and explained that FIGO cancer staging changed 18mnths ago to take the high grade more into account hence me being put on a pathway for chemo and brachytherapy. He didn’t seem to feel the chemo was warranted but also didn’t say that outright! 
So I’m a bit confused abd can’t decide if I want to go ahead with the chemo. I’m waiting for pole test results and trying to get a second opinion from a UK oncologist.
I know there are so many variables but I’m interested to hear what follow up treatment did anyone else have in a similar situation?

womb,Question,EP17,External radiotherapy question,"
I’ve tried to find an answer on the Radiotherapy thread but it’s 63 pages long.
I have a fair idea of how the procedure is done, the need for an enema, drinking water beforehand, more CT scans and the possible side effects but I’m looking to find out about how exposed I’ll be when the radiation is being delivered.
I’m not a prude by any means and can cope with internal examination where they tend to put a blanket over to protect your dignity, but I found the planning CT a bit humiliating. I had a gown on open at the front, no bra and my underwear pulled down so they could line up the lasers and do the tattoos. They used paper towel to try to cover me but that moved as they were positioning me and I just felt so exposed.
My question is can they deliver the radiation through some light clothes or will I be totally uncovered again. I have bought a sports bra with no metal in it to try to alleviate that fear but the thought of no coverage at all is making me anxious.
Can anyone let me know their experience and if they have any tips to try to keep a little bit of dignity during the procedures?

womb,Question,Ali_68,Failed Hysteroscopy - what next?,"
Hello,
A bit of an unusual first post and I do not have a diagnosis yet so hope someone may have had a similar experience?
At the beginning of July I had a post menopausal bleed - it was very much like a period with a beginning, a middle and an end, although was very mild.  As my last period was in August 2022 I thought I'd better get it checked out and I was referred to Gynaecology for investigation.
I had an ultrasound which showed a slight thickening (7mm) and a small polyp - however, as the gynaecologist said - how did the radiographer know that it was a polyp and a biopsy would be required to be sure.
This is where it gets a bit complicated - he asked me there and then if I was happy to have the biopsy done in the office.  I said I felt OK but he should know that I had some issues 10 years ago when my uterus was damaged by the removal of a coil and I was unable to have a new one inserted, even under GA.  He dismissed this and said he was willing to give it a go if I was.  I agreed and sure enough, he could not manoeuvre the instrument into the uterus so I was referred to the next stage to have the procedure done under local anaesthetic - unfortunately this also failed so I was referred onwards to have the procedure done under GA.
I was admitted for day surgery and once again I explained the back story but was re-assured they would be able to successfully take a biopsy and hopefully a polypectomy under GA.  Unfortunately this also failed and a false passage was created resulting in me needing a course of anti-biotics and referral for MRI to see if that might help diagnosis.
I had the MRI the following week (last Monday) and am now waiting for the results.
My questions are:
1. Will the MRI show a clearer picture of the polyp or will it be able to detect cancer without biopsy?
2. Has anyone had a further biopsy done and was this via hysteroscopy again or is there another way of doing this?  Eg, via laparoscopy?

I have been left feeling a little insignificant and can feel myself sliding down the waiting list - I know it's only a small polyp and probably nothing sinister but the extended wait is really starting to bother me now.  
Is there a reasonable wait time before I contact them?
Any advice gratefully received.

womb,Question,Ali_68,Failed Hysteroscopy - what next?,"
Hello,
A bit of an unusual first post and I do not have a diagnosis yet so hope someone may have had a similar experience?
At the beginning of July I had a post menopausal bleed - it was very much like a period with a beginning, a middle and an end, although was very mild.  As my last period was in August 2022 I thought I'd better get it checked out and I was referred to Gynaecology for investigation.
I had an ultrasound which showed a slight thickening (7mm) and a small polyp - however, as the gynaecologist said - how did the radiographer know that it was a polyp and a biopsy would be required to be sure.
This is where it gets a bit complicated - he asked me there and then if I was happy to have the biopsy done in the office.  I said I felt OK but he should know that I had some issues 10 years ago when my uterus was damaged by the removal of a coil and I was unable to have a new one inserted, even under GA.  He dismissed this and said he was willing to give it a go if I was.  I agreed and sure enough, he could not manoeuvre the instrument into the uterus so I was referred to the next stage to have the procedure done under local anaesthetic - unfortunately this also failed so I was referred onwards to have the procedure done under GA.
I was admitted for day surgery and once again I explained the back story but was re-assured they would be able to successfully take a biopsy and hopefully a polypectomy under GA.  Unfortunately this also failed and a false passage was created resulting in me needing a course of anti-biotics and referral for MRI to see if that might help diagnosis.
I had the MRI the following week (last Monday) and am now waiting for the results.
My questions are:
1. Will the MRI show a clearer picture of the polyp or will it be able to detect cancer without biopsy?
2. Has anyone had a further biopsy done and was this via hysteroscopy again or is there another way of doing this?  Eg, via laparoscopy?

I have been left feeling a little insignificant and can feel myself sliding down the waiting list - I know it's only a small polyp and probably nothing sinister but the extended wait is really starting to bother me now.  
Is there a reasonable wait time before I contact them?
Any advice gratefully received.

womb,Question,Sloop,Radiotherapy or Chemotherapy first? Is there a choice.,"
Hi,  in Dec I was diagnosed with a high grade cancer tumour in my womb with some spread to the endemetriol lining.
Very quickly went in for a hysterectomy ( I’m a expat living in Singapore) and am recovering well.
The histology after showed no spread to surrounding organs or lymph nodes and into only 38% of endometrium which is great news but medical staff here still want me to have both brachytherapy and chemo - I think because it’s grade three. 
I’m really struggling to know what to do.
I have paid for the POLE test but know that it’s only 10% chance that I’ll have the mutation and chemo can be ruled out and results are still 4 weeks away. 
The hospital booked me in to see radiotherapist tommorrow and I have a lot of questions to write down as my mind keeps going blank in there. Thank goodness for my husband coming along!
One thing I’m confused about is what order you have things in - chemo first then brachy or simultaneously ?
Wish I could have Brachy then decide later really ! My mind is constantly swinging back and forth between having the chemo - it just seems so extreme.
Wishing I had better statistics or info so I could settle on an answer! Sorry that’s a lot there my brains just trying to apply logic I think and not sure there is much that’s certain to go on really.

womb,Question,EP17,Vaginal cuff dehiscence fears,"
I’m probably getting far ahead of myself as my first oncology appointment isn’t until 8th January. I’ve been told I am stage 3b and am nearly 5 weeks post laparoscopic total hysterectomy and so I am expecting both chemo and radiotherapy. According to what I’ve read laparoscopic and robotic hysterectomies have a higher risk/incidence of vaginal cuff dehiscence. Brachytherapy involves putting something that looks quite big inside the vagina to deliver the radiation and I’m worried that they will tear the vaginal cuff. Does anyone have experience of brachytherapy after a total hysterectomy and if so can you advise if I’m worrying over nothing.

I just had a meeting with my oncologist about my upcoming chemotherapy and I asked him about cold therapy (using ice on hands and feet) during chemotherapy and he outright told me that they don’t do it. He was dismissive about it and said no, the NHS does not do it. I am confused now as I thought that this was also usual in the UK. I have been reading on other forums most frequented by non-UK patients and they always mention icing hands and feet to avoid neuropathy as an option. 
Anyone with experience of cold therapy in here? If yes, can anyone help me and sign post me where to buy them? I would very much like to hear your experiences and if it’s worth it or not.

Hi, I have read through some of your experiences & journeys & think you are all amazing. I found some inspiration & comfort to realise I'm not being dramatic with my concerns at the moment. 
So long story short as possible.....Had gyne issue for years, cervical precancer cells removed twice (20 & 30s) then past 5yrs + began regular pain, bloating, clots, heavy prolonged bleeding, bleeding after sex etc, now 50, so told peri menopausal, IBS etc. Pushed back occasionally as was becoming draining & stopping me doing things. Laporoscopy 2021, no endo, but polyps, fibroids & ovarian cysts found. Told not concerning, wait & see. Had colposcopy last year, apparently all OK. Still in pain, new gyne, suggested mirena fitted. 3 months later, still in pain etc, had TVS which come back as Adenomyosis, polyps &  displaced mirena. Gyne recommended hysteroscopy & mirena removed. 
Chased for 10 months! (Got mirena removed myself via GP after 3 mths) Got another new gynaecologist! (he's fab, came highly recommended) Finally had hysto biopsy, polyps removed & new mirena on 29th Jan. Found procedure fine, was strolling around M&S an hr or so later! 
Expected letter in 6 weeks or so. Got a call on 15th Feb to go in on 21st or 28th for 'follow up'. Found it odd but initially shrugged off. Took the latter as have meetings in work on the 21st. Kicking myself now as starting to get really concerned. Found out the hospital oncology clinic is Wednesdays only & the appointment isn't with my gyne but another consultant who is an oncology specialist! No further details from my call to hospital today except my original consultant has a telephone app booked with me for the month after?
Would it be unusual to get results from a different consultant unless they are related to their field of expertise? (My gyne specialises in pelvic/urogynocolgy) 
I'm quite pragmatic & realise the diagnosis won't change between now & then but I'd rather know sooner rather than later & prepare myself. Also realise I may be letting my imagination run away with me but it's hard to explain, it's like I know something is different? If that makes sense?

womb,Question,MrsHutch24,Had Hysterscopy today...,"
Hi all, 
I had my hysterscopy appointment today, which was very painful in places especially right after ( close to contraction pain) but I got through it. Still uncomfortable now but much better than it was. The consultant managed to find and remove a polyp whilst there too. I'm pre- menopausal and finished  bleeding 2 days ago ( lasted 3 weeks) . The consultant mentioned how thick my endometrium was and said it was likely thicker than my last scan suggested ( 17mm). Of course I need wait for the results now which will seem like an eternity! Whilst doing the hysterscopy the consultant asked me if I had a smear test? I said it is booked for 14th Jan. She said ' good, you need one done'. Now it has me worried. I've also been suffering with pelvic pain and pressure, my tail bone etc... I know cervical and womb cancer are different but it has made me concerned that she said that. 
Any advice/ reassurance is very welcome.

womb,Question,EP17,Oncologists treatment plan,"
I had my first oncology appointment today and am 6 weeks post  hysterectomy with ovaries, cervix and tubes removed.
I went to the appointment today armed with loads of questions and was told that the histology and my recent CT scan suggested the surgery was successful  in that the cancer was removed but the cancer had got to the perimetrium and the margins were very close to the tissue left behind so their plan is:
Radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks with Cisplatin given on days 1 and 22 followed by 4 cycles of chemo using Carboplatin with Paclitaxel.
They took my blood today and tomorrow I have to go to the radiology centre to get more tests and to discuss the radiotherapy. 
Just wondering if anyone else has had the radiotherapy/chemo combination before the main chemo and if so do you know why they did it in that order?
I haven’t got contact details for my CNS yet. I’m hoping to get that tomorrow.

womb,Question,Angiaqua,Appointments given but not taken into account transport.,"
Hi, I am just over 4 weeks post hysterectomy and not driven yet as still bleeding and in pain. I have been relying on family to take me to appointments but none of them live locally to me so its a big trek for them. When I saw the oncologist I did tell them about relatives travelling from afar as well as taking children to school first and could they try to book appointments for chemotherapy that accommodate that. I get a phone call today giving me appointments at 9am and 3.45pm both of which my family are unable to drive me to. I can't seem to find the correct page/phone number to contact red cross to see if they can help me. Which leaves me with trying to drive myself. Both are long journeys likely to be made longer due to rush hour traffic. I am unsure if I can manage driving those journeys myself. The first appointment is less than a week away. I am grateful for such quick appointments. I am just worried that I will end up having to drive myself and either not being able to manage the journeys or harming my healing from the hysterectomy. Any thoughts appreciated.

womb,Question,Kembooks,How long to wait for operation?,"
Hi, this is my first time posting. I’ve been diagnosed with grade 1, probable stage 1a cancer, so thankfully likely very early. However, I’m increasingly worried about the wait for the operation. My biopsy was 12 Nov, it was confirmed as cancer on 26 Nov, the MDT was 12 Dec, but I have no date for the operation. They were aiming for 24/1, but have been told it might be February. There is  backlog and of course it’s been Christmas. 
This feels like a long time. Should I be worried and kick up a fuss or accept that there are clinical priorities ahead of me given my cancer is probably early? I asked about likely timelines before Christmas but the response made me feel I was being a nuisance. 
I’m 53, working full time with teenage children. I really need to plan work and care and the waiting for a date is beginning to drive me a bit mad and I fear I’ve simply been forgotten.

Hello Ladies, (womb women ), 
I hope everyone here are doing well and getting the great support this group gives as at times we no we shouldn't but we do and that is Doctor  Google most times worries the heck out of you and then we come on to MacMillians Womb Community and get back our sensible hat advice and knowledge that everyone of us have or still having issues on SO LET ME START Unfortunately for the last six months after my Radical Hysterectomy I have been having issues with UTI (Urinary Track Infections ), Stress Incontinence, Period Type Pains, Hair falling Out (getting thinner) Tiredness actually not Tiredness more like total Exhaustion so fatigued I could hardly get out of bed,  forgetting information is still worries me even when my sexy hubby or daughter have said something and I have forgotten my daughter tends to get annoyed at me but thank god hubby doesn't, I was also having issues with Pins and Needles and numbness more so left side of my hands as well as Spasms in my right hand as well, I was easily Irritated not to mention having rotten Headaches. 
Eventually after about six or seven weeks my husband got me to send a Consultation to the GP's regarding my worries and symptoms although my most worrying aspect regarded my hair falling out completely just like my dad's and auntie Beanie as I always remember her having a wig on.
Within half an hour I got a email and then a phone call from the surgery informing me that I needed to make an appointment,  I managed to get an appointment the next day, So  Next morning I sat in the surgery waiting to see the GP.
The GP was a new Partner and what was really reassuring was the part that she was on the ball,  the GP  wanted to do more than just a full blood count but other tests to as well as  increasing  my pain relief and also booked an for X-ray's the next day to look at my shoulders as I was still having issues with them.
Three or Four days later I get another phone call to see if I could come in the following afternoon, to see the Doctor, so.
The appointment was very informative she mentioned that I had lost a lot of blood during my operation that left my blood count on borderline and that I wasn't far from a blood transfusion due to the amount I had lost, she explained when I left the hospital my blood count was 160 but now it was 84 and that I was Folate B12 Anemic, she explained that due to having a deficiency in B12 / Folate my body was producing abnormally large Red Blood Cells that do not function properly as the red blood cells carry oxygen around your body using haemoglobin but due to the large blood cell my haemoglobin can't do the correct job transporting the oxygen around my body hence all my symptoms as well as my shoulders showing increased calcium and arthritis she had sent my prescription over right away marking urgent so that I could pick them up and start taking them that night so the Folic Acid tablets and Iron tablets Ferrous Fumarate as well as the increased pain relief, she then informed me that she was writing back to the Gynaecologist, explaining everything that has happened since my hysterectomy but also a letter to the Gastroenterology just to check that I am not bleeding and why my system is not absorbing B12 as I might have Celiac or anything else as my Iron levels should have being going up and not down within the last six months.
I also wanted to ask if anyone has had the a smear called Virginal Vault and how was it for example more painful than the original smear test and if you needed painkillers before the procedure.

womb,Question,WILMA 08,LOW BLOOD COUNT AFTER OPERATION ON 24 May 2024,"
Hello Ladies, (womb women ), 
I hope everyone here are doing well and getting the great support this group gives as at times we no we shouldn't but we do and that is Doctor  Google most times worries the heck out of you and then we come on to MacMillians Womb Community and get back our sensible hat advice and knowledge that everyone of us have or still having issues on SO LET ME START Unfortunately for the last six months after my Radical Hysterectomy I have been having issues with UTI (Urinary Track Infections ), Stress Incontinence, Period Type Pains, Hair falling Out (getting thinner) Tiredness actually not Tiredness more like total Exhaustion so fatigued I could hardly get out of bed,  forgetting information is still worries me even when my sexy hubby or daughter have said something and I have forgotten my daughter tends to get annoyed at me but thank god hubby doesn't, I was also having issues with Pins and Needles and numbness more so left side of my hands as well as Spasms in my right hand as well, I was easily Irritated not to mention having rotten Headaches. 
Eventually after about six or seven weeks my husband got me to send a Consultation to the GP's regarding my worries and symptoms although my most worrying aspect regarded my hair falling out completely just like my dad's and auntie Beanie as I always remember her having a wig on.
Within half an hour I got a email and then a phone call from the surgery informing me that I needed to make an appointment,  I managed to get an appointment the next day, So  Next morning I sat in the surgery waiting to see the GP.
The GP was a new Partner and what was really reassuring was the part that she was on the ball,  the GP  wanted to do more than just a full blood count but other tests to as well as  increasing  my pain relief and also booked an for X-ray's the next day to look at my shoulders as I was still having issues with them.

womb,Question,WILMA 08,VIRGINAL VAULT SMEAR TEST,"
HI Womb Community (Ladies), As mentioned in my previous post regarding how  uncomfortable the Vault Smear Teast Is and not to mention once again the dreaded waiting times regarding results.
My appointment was on 24th December 2024 at 13:35 pm at the Royal Infirmary Edinburgh informed Dr was running a little late (can't be helped ) so the Consultant seen us sitting waiting and gave us a wee wave saying "" your next Williamina & Allistair"" waving back saying   ""NO WORRIES"" to him, so went in discussing BP being really low, and low blood count and not forgetting how tired I still feel so he explained everything that caused the blood loss, and the two more extra hours in surgery,  Then he mentioned the dreaded Smear Test that had to be done due to the tests not having enough information regarding cancer cells in my cervix so me, So up I hope onto the examination bed expressing how I hoped he had forgotten the examination after ten or so min it was done and dusted and was kindly informed to take it easy for the rest of the day.
NOW it's the waiting time which no doubt will be longer over the festive season I must admit I have been a little nippy and stressed whilst waiting if I'm honest.
How did anyone feel about the Smear Teast was it uncomfortable or a little painful with pain relief.
Anyway I WISH EVERYONE A HAPPY NEW YEAR IN 2025 AND ALL THE BEST TO YOU AND YOURS DURING THIS 2025 XXX

womb,Question,FifiK,Gastritis as side effect of immunotherapy for endometrial cancer,"
Hi I’m just wondering if anyone has experienced gastritis when on immunotherapy treatment for endometrial cancer. I have been struggling with nausea, no appetite and not eating much at all for over 4 weeks now. I had an endoscopy last week which showed inflammation and since been on anti sickness and omeprazole. Still feeling no better and struggling to get answers from my oncology team about whether this could be a side effect of dostarlimab ( the immunotherapy). Would appreciate hearing of anyone else who may have experienced similar.

I had a hysterectomy at the beginning of November 2024 after being diagnosed with stage 3 womb cancer .  I have physically recovered really well and am nearly back to some sort of normality - whatever that is when you have been diagnosed with cancer.  Is it normal at 76 to have mood swings after a hysterectomy?  I have noticed that I have been getting rather emotional and tearful at silly things and am even wondering if at my age it is actually worth continuing with further treatment.  I had a telephone consultation with the oncologist just before Xmas and she said that the cancer was of a type that is of higher risk of spreading and it is planned that I have 5 weeks of radiotherapy with chemo as well in the last couple of weeks and have an appointment next week to have the various pre-treatments tests.

womb,Question,Silverflute,No bleeding but abnormal ultrasound - awaiting biopsy results,"
Has anyone had results of  abnormal endometrial lining from ultrasound but had no symptoms of bleeding?
I'm 51, My symptoms have been:
Pain in the pelvic area, and lumbar like period pain but no bleeding
increased urge to pee 
sometimes painful sex
fatigue
painful feet
general aching body/stiffness
previous low vit D it is now just in range at 51
I went to the gp with these symptoms and was referred in march to gynae for menopause advice. Had my appointment last week. Luckily had an abdo ultrasound and TVUS days before going to the gynae appointment as i went to annoy the gp over symptoms again.
there was something abnormal on the scan and so had biopsy while i was at the appointment, which I wasn't prepared for. Now im waiting for the results.
I have a history of breast cancer which was er positive, grade 3, 5cm with lymphvascular invasion but not found in the nodes. This was diagnosed 10 yrs ago. I had all the treatment and had tamoxifen but i only took it for 3/4 years i was fed up of what i thought were side effects.
In the past before diagnosed with breast cancer. In 2013-2014 i began having extremely heavy periods i had to change pad and heavy tampon every hour or two... it was awful at work. I became anaemic and had low ferritin and bruised easily I was very tired etc. I went to the GP I then had the mirena coil and that stopped the bleeding. I never had a pelvic scan to find the cause of sudden heavy bleeding or any investigation.
In 2014 I was so tired I couldn't cope with my job I left and did something else. I had morning nausea, sometimes painful sex and breasts. eventually I found a lump to me it felt large and went to my GP and while she couldn't feel anything and told me not to worry and said don't bother taking anyone with you i don't think its anything. I went to the hospital and the consultant could feel anything so she thought there was nothing (by this time i thought i must have been imagining it) but the mammogram showed clearly a large tumor that even i could see what it was. I immediately had a biopsy which was difficult to take and was told i had cancer and i would need surgery chemo and radiotherapy, that was in october 2014.

I am wondering if all this is linked but i guess i just have to be patient for the results

Urgent referral with post menopausal bleeding - feeling pretty scared
I don't know how I feel really, but confused.  Feel wimpy that the Dr advised stopping doing the hysteroscopy a couple of days ago  - after the initial go, because he said it showed polyps that needed removing and that it would get more painful with a larger hysteroscope but ' it was my choice' (Ultrasound showed uterus lining was 5.7 mm, which I realise isn't huge) He offered me a general anaesthetic when I arrived at the outpatient appointment, but because I had been worried about it since the appointment was booked the previous day, I thought I'd try and get it over with and stop the worrying.
The ultrasound biopsy had come back as insufficient and I'd been booked straight in for the hysteroscopy as a result (the efficiency is good, if also worrying)
Any advice please?

womb,Question,Light99,Doubts about adjuvant treatment of serous endometrial cancer and biopsy waiting times,"
Good evening, my mother was diagnosed on November 1st with endometrial cancer, poorly differentiated serous type, p53 positive and p16 positive with the mass more than 50%, after several tests they found that it seems to be confined to the uterus and not metastasized and on December 6th she was operated.I have terrible doubts for the following reasons:we were not told what type of adjuvant therapy will be done, they were talking about radiotherapy and in any case we have to wait for the histological exam.
I searched online and the recommended treatment for this type of tumor is chemotherapy and radiotherapy (portec-3 study).The problem is that initially they said that the histological exam will be ready after 30 days, yesterday I went to the hospital to see if it was possible to hurry in some way and now they told me that it will take 45 days because of the holidays.
I am desperate because I should wait 45 days for the results and then wait for the oncologists to meet and decide which treatment, in a context in which adjuvant treatment should be started as soon as possible depending on the type of tumor (my mother had a record recovery and after 2 weeks she is already in shape)
I signed up to have support, to understand how to move (even through legal channels or otherwise to try to speed things up) because it creates anguish in me that my mother's aggressive tumor (less than 10% of the serous type on all types of tumors that cause 50% of total deaths) is treated so lightly.

womb,Question,Rhona 1980,Ongoing pain and infections for last two months,"
Hi all, my name is Rhona and this is my first post.   I was diagnosed with stage 3 womb cancer August 2023 and have had chemotherapy and radiotherapy.  The radiotherapy ended February 2024.  
Long history follows!
My oncologist has me on letrozole following my last CT scan (end of September 2024).  I have been taking this since the first week of October.  However I have had numerous infections (some diagnosed as UTIs) and one infection of unknown origin left me in hospital for two weeks on antibiotics.  They performed a CT scan in the hospital to see if I had a fistula but that came back negative.  The only thing that was showing that I had an infection was my bloods and microbiology were involved to work out the appropriate antibiotics.
I have consistently had pain in my pelvic region and lower back since October and while pain relief does help I am finding that it isn't working as well now.  I currently take paracetamol and dihydrocodeine.  I was taking naproxen but stopped last week when I started taking ciprofloxacin (another antibiotic) as prescribed by my GP.  I am also eating very little as I struggle to keep most food down.
My GP has advised that I should go to A&E as they can do more tests and get me referred to the right department.  She can't refer me without a diagnosis and they don't have the expertise to make a diagnosis.  I am going to go back to A&E as I can't go on like this.
Has anyone had similar experiences?  I just feel like whatever is wrong with me is not getting better.  My oncologist isn't very helpful (basically dismissed my pain when I brought it up) but I do wonder if the letrozole is the problem.  I have asked the GP and hospital but they don't think so.  Any advice is gratefully received.

From yesterday after I've eaten small amounts I have had diahorrea, is this normal from the hysterectomy or could it be partly because the bowel surgeon became involved in my procedure? If it's common from hysterectomy how long does this last?

womb,Question,Pendle,Next steps - brachytherapy,"
Hi Everyone,
I had a call from the Clinical Nurse Specialist to go through the pathology results after my operation.
There were no signs of any cancer in the fallopian tubes or ovaries - yay!
There was a tumour in the womb that we mostly knew about from the hysteroscopies however the tumour had grown down and was touching the cervix, so my official stage is 2 with grade 1 cells.
The CNS said I am now being offered 3 rounds of vaginal brachytherapy and I am seeing the consultant at the Edinburgh cancer centre next week.
I've read a bit about the brachytherapy procedure, and I am a little confused mainly about the side effects. 
Now I appreciate that it's not as bad as chemo, so I guess I should count myself lucky.  But I understand that weight gain is a possibility.  I know I'm going to come across as really shallow here, but this bothers me a great deal.  I've had weight problems most of my adult life, some illness related, some psychological and a fair amount of eating too many pies!
I have worked hard over the last 15 years to get my weight down and have lost just over 7.5 stone (46 kilos) in that time and kept it off.  I've had fluctuations, but have managed these.  I really don't want to have to go through anything that might jeopardise this.  Especially as whenever I see a medic I'm always told I'm too overweight - I never get any credit for the loss.
Can anyone who has been through this procedure let me know how it went for them?
thanks.

womb,Question,PaddingtonBear,Hysterectomy next week. Very anxious.,"
Hi everyone. Just reaching out as I’m getting terribly anxious about my hysterectomy next week. I’m already booked in even though full histology isn’t yet back as my oncologist could see what he needed on MRI, CT and Vaginal ultrasound. Have also now had a hysteroscopy under GA and will see my consultant again next week before the op to tell me what type/grade etc. I’m so scared. Even without full histology I’m booked in for a ‘radical hysterectomy’ plus tubes and ovaries to be removed. I had breast cancer 8 years ago for which I went through surgery, chemo and radiotherapy so this feels like such a knock back. I’m trying to keep positive but my mind keeps spiralling, particularly if I need to have chemo again. I know I’ve just got to hold tight and wait to see my consultant (the MDT meeting is tomorrow when they will discuss my case).

womb,Question,PaddingtonBear,Hysterectomy next week. Very anxious.,"
Hi everyone. Just reaching out as I’m getting terribly anxious about my hysterectomy next week. I’m already booked in even though full histology isn’t yet back as my oncologist could see what he needed on MRI, CT and Vaginal ultrasound. Have also now had a hysteroscopy under GA and will see my consultant again next week before the op to tell me what type/grade etc. I’m so scared. Even without full histology I’m booked in for a ‘radical hysterectomy’ plus tubes and ovaries to be removed. I had breast cancer 8 years ago for which I went through surgery, chemo and radiotherapy so this feels like such a knock back. I’m trying to keep positive but my mind keeps spiralling, particularly if I need to have chemo again. I know I’ve just got to hold tight and wait to see my consultant (the MDT meeting is tomorrow when they will discuss my case).

womb,Question,EP17,Post hysterectomy appointment didn’t go the way I thought.,"
When I was initially referred by my GP an ultrasound showed the endometrium 8 mm with some free fluid.
The hysteroscopy/D&C was unsuccessful because he couldn’t get the cervix dilated enough but an MRI did indicate that it was cancer, caught early, and I had my uterus, ovaries and tubes removed 2 weeks ago. No lymph nodes were removed.
Today was my follow up appointment and the consultant told me that he performed the op judging that it was probably a stage 2. That was not the case when the tissue was examined and its stage 3b serous adenocarcinoma.
He has advised that after discussion with the oncologists  he is not going to go back in to remove nodes or anything else rather I will be referred to the local cancer centre and will have both chemotherapy and internal and external radiotherapy. 
Me and my husband are totally floored by this and I’m afraid to try to look up any information. 
Just looking for any advice or information to help us get through the next few weeks before they are able to start the treatment.
Thanks

I have an appointment tomorrow with a consultant who is advising me to have my ovaries and potentially my uterus removed, maybe other bits too. This is purely precautionary as I don't  currently have ovarian or womb cancer.

Hi everyone,
I had my initial consultation after my 2ww today. Consultant said I would need a hysterscopy due to my symptoms and that the scan showed an endometrium of 17mm, 2 days after a 4 week bleed. He suggested that I have the hysterscopy under local, where they will take the biopsy. Does anyone have any experience of this being done under a local anaesthetic? What can I expect? He said it should be done within 2- 4 weeks, the results could be another 2-3 weeks after that, it feels like such a long wait!

The gynecologist tried to do a biopsy but it was too painful to tolerate especially with aged related atrophy and Lichen Sclerosis.

Hi,
I am unfortunately new here. I am 32 and have just been diagnosed with womb cancer. My hysterectomy is the end of November and I am now finding that I am beginning to feel deflated and very fed up and trying to continue with normal day to day life. I’m just wondering has anyone else got any pointers etc, I was diagnosed a week before starting my new role via promotion, so I am currently training. 
Also, just wondering if anyone can give me any insight on what to prepare for/expect. I have tried to do as much research as possible but thought speaking to those from experience might be more insightful. 
There has been discussion as to whether or not to remove my ovaries due to my age and menopause, has anyone got any opinions on this? I’m leaning toward removing them as I’m just scared of tempting fate and anything coming back to that area. 
Thanks in advance!

womb,Question,WILMA 08,Still Having Issues 6 Month's After The Big Operation.,"
Hello Ladies, (womb women ), 
I hope everyone here are doing well and getting the great support this group gives as at times we no we shouldn't but we do and that is Doctor  Google most times worries the heck out of you and then we come on to MacMillians Womb Community and get back our sensible hat through the advice and knowledge that everyone of us have or still having issues on SO LET ME START Unfortunately for the last six months after my Radical Hysterectomy I have been having issues with UTI (Urinary Track Infections ), Stress Incontinence, Period Type Pains, Hair falling Out (getting thinner) Tiredness actually not Tiredness more like total Exhaustion sor fatigued I could hardly get out of bed without forgetting information when my sexy hubby or daughter have said something as well as Pins and Needles in my hands and fingers as well as Spasms in them too, and so easily Irritated not to mention rotten Headaches, so eventually after about six or seven weeks my husband got me to send a Consultation to the GP's as what was worrying me most was my hair falling out completely just like my dad's and auntie Beanie as I always remember her having a wig on.
Within half an hour I got a email and then a phone call from the surgery saying or morke like asking me if I could come in the next day at (which I said yes ). Next morning I sat in the surgery waiting to see the GP.
The GP was a new partner and really on the ball she wanted to do more than just a full blood count but other tests to and increased my pain relief as well as booking me for X-ray's the next day to look at my shoulders as I was still having issues with them.
Three or Four days later I get another phone call to see if I could come in the following afternoon, to see the Doctor, so.
The appointment was very informative she mentioned that I had lost a lot of blood during my operation that left my blood count on borderline and that I wasn't far from a blood transfusion due to the amount I had lost, she explained when I left the hospital my blood count was 160 but now it was 84 and that I was Folate B12 Anemic, she explained that due to having a deficiency in B12 / Folate my body was producing abnormally large Red Blood Cells that do not function properly as the red blood cells carry oxygen around your body using haemoglobin but due to the large blood cell my haemoglobin can't do the correct job transporting the oxygen around my body hence all my symptoms as well as my shoulders showing increased calcium and arthritis she had sent my prescription over right away marking urgent so that I could pick them up and start taking them that night so the Folic Acid tablets and Iron tablets Ferrous Fumarate as well as the increased pain relief, she then informed me that she was writing back to the Gynaecologist, explaining everything that has happened since my hysterectomy but also a letter to the Gastrointerologist just to check that I am not bleeding and why my system is not absorbing B12 as I might have Celiac or anything else as my Iron levels should have being going up and not down within the last six months.
I also wanted to ask if anyone has had the a smear called Virginal Vault and how was it for example more painful than the original smear test and if you needed painkillers before the procedure.

My results came back from MRI Scan and they confirmed it's not spread to the lymph nodes. They have confirmed it's Grade 1 endometrial cancer. I now have a date for hysterectomy on the 12th of December.
My understanding is that the staging won't be given until the results come back from hysterectomy is this correct.?
My worry is that the results will come back with different grade or a higher stage, how common is this?
Also how long will I need to take off work for a hysterectomy?

womb,Question,Mandrix4,Radiotherapy & Chemotherapy,"
Hi
I was originally scheduled for 25 sessions of adjuvant radiotherapy starting in September which should have finished this last Friday. However after the planning scan and having the tattoo marks done ready I had a call from the consultant to say I had a lymph node which looked off in the right pelvis area. I needed another scan before having treatment. My original treatment plan was cancelled and I had to wait 2 weeks for a CT scan, then a wait for results. 
On Wednesday I had an appointment and was advised I commence 27 sessions of radiotherapy from this coming Monday. This will also include chemo. I think the chemo drug is Cisplati and it will be administered on Wednesday of the 1st and the 4th week of radiotherapy. 
Further chemo has also been mentioned when the results of this treatment are reviewed. I think up to another 4 rounds of a different chemo.
Just wondering if anyone else has had chemo whilst having radiotherapy?

womb,Question,Cgggg,Hysteroscopy and Medical Trauma,"
I am now 9 weeks in on a urgent cancer pathway with no diagnosis. I am neurodiverse have extreme medical trauma and cannot attend any medical establishments or medical appointments without severe panic attacks despite taking Diazepam before attending. I have had one failed hysteroscopy due to the consultant aborting it as he could not find a clear channel despite using 1/2 and 3/4 hegar dilators to try and find one. He felt the prospects of success were limited and complications a concern if he continued.He proposed a repeat procedure under general anaesthetic but my trauma would find that too much to cope with. I can force myself through an office procedure but there are too many layers to a ga. I could not cope with the preop tests, I am an insulin dependant diabetic and my blood sugars would be uncontrollable, I don't cope with people or them monitoring me and doing things to me. I wouldn't cope with being in a hospital ward either or the admittance or stay afterwards, which is likely to be more extended than a few hours due to how my blood sugars and blood pressure would react. I also need galsses to be able to see and hearing aids to hear and without them I feel very exposed and vulnerable, even for a few minutes.
I have agreed a reasonable adjustment of two supporters during appointments but obviously this would not be possible if I had a proceedure under ga.
I appreciate that most people would find the procedure more acceptable with general anaesethic, but not me. I mentioned regional or conscious sedation but apparently they are not offered by my trust and would in any case need all the preop tests and admittance. Another attempt at an in office procedure is being attempted on Wednesday but is likely to fail. I have also been told that there is no guarnatee that an operating room proceedure would be any more successful. I struggled with the tvus which was aborted in the first instance due to a panic attack, but achieved in a second attempt on another day. I have been offered an mri but would not be able to tolerate it.
I have spoken with the MCMillan helpline this morning but just wondering what tips everyone has for overcoming extreme anxiety and forcing themeselves through the tests and interractions. I don't have any continuity of care, Wednesday I will be seing athird different consultant.My last consultation  I was so paniced I shook the whole time and was unable to speak without stuttering and struggling for breath. I have arange of techniques, music, mindfulness, meditation, breathing etc for trying to ground myself but none are working.

womb,Question,Cgggg,Hysteroscopy and Medical Trauma,"
I am now 9 weeks in on a urgent cancer pathway with no diagnosis. I am neurodiverse have extreme medical trauma and cannot attend any medical establishments or medical appointments without severe panic attacks despite taking Diazepam before attending. I have had one failed hysteroscopy due to the consultant aborting it as he could not find a clear channel despite using 1/2 and 3/4 hegar dilators to try and find one. He felt the prospects of success were limited and complications a concern if he continued.He proposed a repeat procedure under general anaesthetic but my trauma would find that too much to cope with. I can force myself through an office procedure but there are too many layers to a ga. I could not cope with the preop tests, I am an insulin dependant diabetic and my blood sugars would be uncontrollable, I don't cope with people or them monitoring me and doing things to me. I wouldn't cope with being in a hospital ward either or the admittance or stay afterwards, which is likely to be more extended than a few hours due to how my blood sugars and blood pressure would react. I also need galsses to be able to see and hearing aids to hear and without them I feel very exposed and vulnerable, even for a few minutes.
I have agreed a reasonable adjustment of two supporters during appointments but obviously this would not be possible if I had a proceedure under ga.
I appreciate that most people would find the procedure more acceptable with general anaesethic, but not me. I mentioned regional or conscious sedation but apparently they are not offered by my trust and would in any case need all the preop tests and admittance. Another attempt at an in office procedure is being attempted on Wednesday but is likely to fail. I have also been told that there is no guarnatee that an operating room proceedure would be any more successful. I struggled with the tvus which was aborted in the first instance due to a panic attack, but achieved in a second attempt on another day. I have been offered an mri but would not be able to tolerate it.
I have spoken with the MCMillan helpline this morning but just wondering what tips everyone has for overcoming extreme anxiety and forcing themeselves through the tests and interractions. I don't have any continuity of care, Wednesday I will be seing athird different consultant.My last consultation  I was so paniced I shook the whole time and was unable to speak without stuttering and struggling for breath. I have arange of techniques, music, mindfulness, meditation, breathing etc for trying to ground myself but none are working.
Also has anyone any experience of a failed in office procedure but achieved a successful result on a second attempt without ga? Pain was not an issue on the first attempt, the abortion was solely due to the consultant not being able to establish a clear channel for the scope.

womb,Question,EP17,Post menopausal diagnosis,"
Hi all.
I’m currently waiting for contact from medics after the multi disciplinary team discuss my symptoms.
I’m in my early 60’s and first went to my GP in August because of having a discharge. I saw a consultant at the end of August who did a scan told me the endometrium was 8mm and there was 1cm of free fluid. I needed a D&C and biopsy. That wasn’t attempted until 18th October because we had a holiday booked, but my cervix couldn’t be dilated so I had an MRI on 23rd October.
The consultant called me the next day and said my case would be put to the MDT and mentioned surgery and our nearest cancer centre. I wasn’t entirely shocked because I’m one of those who googles everything. 
My question is what should I expect to happen now? It's obviously very early days in my journey.  How soon should I expect to hear from them and do you think it’s likely I’ll have surgery before Christmas?
Many thanks

womb,Question,LondonGirl8,Post hysterectomy recovery,"
Hi all,
I had a hysterectomy about 11 days ago to treat endometrial carcinoma. I’ve always had a bit of a delicate digestive system, which runs in my family, but for about a week now I’ve been really suffering with an upset stomach (downstairs). Initially I didn’t have much “movement” when I was in the hospital so I took lactulose for a few days as prescribed, and things seemed to even out for a while but it’s now been quite a few days since I came off it and I’m still dealing with having to go to the toilet quite a few times a day, and stomach cramps, and it’s really getting me down mentally at this point. Physically, this aside, I’m feeling so much better so this feels like the one thing that’s not making progress so that’s hard…
I know the guidance talks about bladder and bowel taking a while to settle after this surgery, which does make sense so my question is basically - is this normal and can I do anything to help or is it just another “wait it out” thing?
Any advice gratefully received!

Thank you

womb,Question,Anxious Flo,Re-occurring uterine polyps and thickened womb lining,"
Hi, I’m post menopausal (6 years) and taking HRT. I have had heavy bleeding, lost 8lb in weight, cramping, nausea and bloating for nearly 3 weeks. I’ve just had a Hysteroscopy and been told that I have a cluster of polyps, thickened womb lining of 13mm and a heterogenous (uneven) uterus. I’ve already had a couple of polyps removed twice during a hysteroscopy, the last being 5 months ago. This time I wasn’t given the option of having them removed during the procedure and couldn’t have the Mirena coil inserted as discussed. 
I’ve been offered a trans cervical resection under the 2 week rule to remove them and some of the lining or to have a total laparoscopic hysterectomy. I’m so scared that I gave endometrial cancer and don’t know which option to take. The hospital is going to call me on Monday for my decision. 
Any advise would be appreciated - many thanks x

womb,Question,Pendle,Hysteroscopy results and next steps,"
Hello everyone,
I finally had my results from the hysteroscopy in September.  The consultant had said that she saw suspicious tissue in the womb that could be cancer.
And she was right.
My background is, that I had a small polyp which was cancerous last year.  A mirena coil was fitted and had seemed to stop further growth, but the hysteroscopy in March 2024 showed a very small amount of pre-cancer and grade 1 cells.
What bothers me, is that in March, the consultant said that the pathologist had to do a lot to find those pre-cancer cells, and yet 6 months later, the ""polypoidal"" tissue is seen during a regular procedure by the surgeon.  Have they grown that quick?
Next I'm to have an MRI scan and CT scan.  My NHS board has them done if the last lot are over 2 months old, which I presume is why I'm having them.  The last time, there was no sign of any cancer on those scans.
And then, probably in time for Christmas, it's a hysterectomy.  Happy Christmas me!
I know that I have been very lucky because my only obvious symptom was a small post-menopausal bleed.  I was taking desogestrel for a long while to stem a heavy flow which ended up with years of no bleeding, so I'm not really sure when I started/ended the menopause.  I only came off them during the pandemic when I'd queried menopause with my GP.  I've had no hot flushes or night sweats, just a fuzzy brain every now and again, dry skin, thinning hair etc.
If I'm through the menopause (I'm 56), will having a hysterectomy mean I could still get symptoms?  Would I need HRT?
It's probably psychosomatic, but I've had a niggling pain down in that region since I got my results.  I think it's going to remind me that it's not going away without surgery!
I'm really just thinking aloud to myself, I know I need to speak the to the clinical nurse specialist for answers.

womb,Question,kelima,MRI scan - heavier bleeding afterwards,"
Hello everyone, 
I was placed on the suspected uterine cancer pathway 21/2 weeks ago, following a bleed. Biopsy results a week ago confirmed cancer and yesterday I had an MRI scan. I had no symptoms until 3 weeks ago when I had the first bleed, and since then I have experienced intermittent bleeding/ brown discharge and intermittent lower abdominal / back pain. 
During the night I have been bleeding more heavily and I just wondered if this was usual after an MRI scan and anyone else experienced this or just a coincidence and part of the cancer journey.

womb,Question,Willowhawk,Brachytherapy,"
Hello,
I have some concerns regarding the Brachytherapy treatments I am scheduled to start 10/7/2024. I will be receiving 7Gy each time on October 7,9,14th. It is Cylinder single channel. The dose time is 5-15 min per treatment. Has anyone had this and if so, what has been your experience? Pain during, painful urination anytime after, bowel problems anytime after, nausea, any other physical pain and or fatigue? My diagnosis is Stage 1A Grade 1 with only (1) of 7 sentinel lymph nodes positive. I had Radical hysterectomy, I now have vaginal cuff.  I am extremely nervous to have this treatment but have been told it will give me a 95% chance of no recurrence, however they do tell me nothing is a 100% guarantee.
Thank you for your time,

womb,Question,Willowhawk,Brachytherapy,"
Hello,
I have some concerns regarding the Brachytherapy treatments I am scheduled to start 10/7/2024. I will be receiving 7Gy each time on October 7,9,14th. It is Cylinder single channel. The dose time is 5-15 min per treatment. Has anyone had this and if so, what has been your experience? Pain during, painful urination anytime after, bowel problems anytime after, nausea, any other physical pain and or fatigue? My diagnosis is Stage 1A Grade 1 with only (1) of 7 sentinel lymph nodes positive. I had Radical hysterectomy, I now have vaginal cuff.  I am extremely nervous to have this treatment but have been told it will give me a 95% chance of no recurrence, however they do tell me nothing is a 100% guarantee.
Thank you for your time, 
Willow

womb,Question,LoulouFrancaise,Biopsy results and follow up PET scan,"
Hi all, 
I hoped some of you may be able to share your experience. My results came back from laparoscopy on Monday. Cancer nurse told me I have grade 3 uterine cancer and that it’s approaching the cervix. Now have a PET scan tomorrow. 
The next MDT is Monday so they should decide a surgery date then. My fiancé and I are getting married on 26th October. Not sure whether to cancel the reception or not. We will get married even if I have to crawl there. I’m in Lincolnshire and I’ve been told I’ll probably have my surgery in Nottingham . 
How long do you think it will take after PET scan to have surgery?
Is the PET scan because they think it has spread? 
Has anyone else had experience of Nottingham hospital? 
Anyone else had stage 3 and a pet scan? What was your outcome? 
Trying to get an idea of how long things will take. I can’t get any real answers yet. I’ll need to decide about wedding by next Thursday. Obviously, we are so stressed out by all this that the wedding no longer seems special. 
Thanks. I hope everyone is doing ok in the alternate universe we find ourselves in x

womb,Question,GFmom,Confused - Inconclusive,"
Hi there,
I am looking for some advice?
I had some bleeding last year I'm 55 years old and my GP said he would refer me, my first hysteroscopy they found a polyp, then informed me that this would be removed. After a lot of cancelled appointments and mix ups due to me wanting next procedure done under general anaesthetic I finally had polyp removed they also did another biopsy. I got a telephone call to meet with a consultant who informed me the biopsy results were inconclusive and he would recommend a hysterectomy given my age symptoms being overweight etc. I now have a further biopsy booked in 2 weeks time. I asked the consultant if the results came back inconclusive again would he's still recommend the hysterectomy, he said yes.
He also recommended coming off HRT.
Just trying to get my head round this.
He said I could call him if I have any questions, what kind of questions should I be asking?
Any help would be appreciated

womb,Question,Angela1963,Hormone therapy treatment,"
Hello
i was diagnosed in April with endometrial cancer , I was expecting to have a hysterectomy  because at 61 this year and having had my menopause 8 years ago thought it would be a straight forward thing. However my surgeon had other ideas he said because i was on warfarin, diabetic and overweight, a hysterectomy might be a risky thing. He has put me on Hormone therapy treatment instead. I am taking a large amount of Provera and have had a mirena coil fitted as well.
I was wondering if anyone else has had this treatment, and how they got on with it. I am really struggling with it , since taking this i am waking up soaked every day, i never had any of this when i went through the menopause, i am not sleeping well and feel so tired all the time, also my ankle keeps swelling up and the discharge i had has got much worse i have to wear a pad all the time, is this normal ?? its not pleasant and i feel if i had had a hysterectomy it would be all over and done with, i have tried looking it all up but cant find anything, i am due a 3 month check up in October where i will have to have another biopsy. 75% of women who have this treatment is supposed to be successful, i just feel anxious with all my symptoms its not working.

womb,Question,Angela1963,Hormone therapy treatment,"
Hello
i was diagnosed in April with endometrial cancer , I was expecting to have a hysterectomy  because at 61 this year and having had my menopause 8 years ago thought it would be a straight forward thing. However my surgeon had other ideas he said because i was on warfarin, diabetic and overweight, a hysterectomy might be a risky thing. He has put me on Hormone therapy treatment instead. I am taking a large amount of Provera and have had a mirena coil fitted as well.
I was wondering if anyone else has had this treatment, and how they got on with it. I am really struggling with it , since taking this i am waking up soaked every day, i never had any of this when i went through the menopause, i am not sleeping well and feel so tired all the time, also my ankle keeps swelling up and the discharge i had has got much worse i have to wear a pad all the time, is this normal ?? its not pleasant and i feel if i had had a hysterectomy it would be all over and done with, i have tried looking it all up but cant find anything, i am due a 3 month check up in October where i will have to have another biopsy. 75% of women who have this treatment is supposed to be successful, i just feel anxious with all my symptoms its not working. Just wanted to know who else has had this treatment and did you have all these symptons

womb,Question,Teutonin,support ligaments of the womb,"
Hi All, I've been given a lot of information in paper form about the surgery.  It will be a hysterectomy with removal of the ovaries and fallopian tubes. Yesterday I spoke to the anaesthetist who said they would remove everything and job done. No need to stitch support ligaments to the vagina as described. Apparently nothing will roll around inside apart from the bowels which will just spread out and drop to the bottom (my words now). With an already prolapsed bladder I'm not feeling comfortable right now. Any experiences anyone?

womb,Question,MadamT,Metastatic endometrial cancer in the lungs - treatment,"
I had hysterectomy 5 years ago and 26 external radiotherapy sessions with a very good result, however, last month I went to the doctor as I was coughing a little blood.  One x-ray led to an immediate CT scan and next day meeting with my GP for a rapid referral for suspected lung cancer.  Biopsy, PET/CT scan and lung function tests all revealed that it was my original endometrial cancer which had metastacised into 2 lung tumours and an array of nodes in my other lung.  I'm due to start Paclitaxel and carboplatin in a couple of weeks and I wondered whether anyone else has gone through this?  It feels weird having treatment for secondary endometrial cancer when it didn't return in the pelvic area and it was a massive shock - not least because I had just taken early retirement at 63.  Anyway, it is what it is now but would welcome hearing about the success of this treatment for lung leisions.

womb,Question,Steph1407,Anxious about biopsy results,"
Hi!
This is my first post, and feeling like a bit of a fraud because I don't have a diagnosis yet but my brain is spiralling...

I was placed on cancer pathway August 12th after a TV US showed thickened endometrium of 43mm amongst other symptoms of heavy flooding, pelvic pain and prolonged bleeding.
I had a hysteroscopy on August 30th, Lining was still 42mm after 60 days of bleeding and had a cervical polyp and a 2cm uterine polyp removed.

On Wednesday 11th September I received a call telling me I needed to come in to discuss biopsy results, an appointment was made for Thursday 19th and a notification came through on my MFT (Manchester foundation trust) confirming my appointment with an oncologist.... Queue the panic! (I received an information leaflet about what could happen on the day and the information that I can bring a family member or friend along with me.

On Thursday 12th I received another phonecall, informing me the consultant who carried out the hysteroscopy would like me to come in to discuss results from the hysteroscopy but that he had no available appointments within the next week so would like me to come down to an emergency gynaecology unit on wednesday 18th at whatever time is best for me as he would make time to see me when i arrived (no mention of bringing support with me).. i explained id already had an appointment made for the day after and I was told it was to discuss something else.

I then received another phonecall the next day informing me they were cancelling the Thursday appointment because the consultant who performed the hysteroscopy will go through it all with me instead of me having 2 appointments.

I'm now so confused and anxious, I don't know if it's a good thing that I'm now not seeing the oncologist or whether it doesn't make a difference, and I'm left trying to decipher every bit of information (such as not being told to bring someone with me) 

I feel like because the appointment was made with oncology first it's not a good sign but I did see an oncologist at the start of my cancer pathway referral who ordered the hysteroscopy. 

Sorry for the extra long first post of information dumping but my brain is spiralling and any input would be really appreciated!

womb,Question,Jenlight,Hysteroscopy biopsy results waiting time.,"
HI, I’m on the 2ww cancer referral. I had a hysteroscopy on the 20th August. They took some biopsies as he could see thickening of my womb. On the trans scan they could see that my lining was 24mm thick. The endometrium is slightly irregular in outline, thickened and heterogeneous in echotexture and I have a fibroid. I’m 41 pre menopausal. I’ve been having very heavy flooding periods with very large clots.  I’m constantly checking my nhs app for results, chasing the postman like a crazy women, checking my phone for a phone call.  
How long have others waited for their results I think I need to chill out a bit but it’s driving me insane.

womb,Question,Jhibhan,Colonoscopy/biopsy,"
Hi everyone 
would just like some advice/your experiences through this part of my journey. 
I had an ultrasound last week, following a post menopausal bleed and received a call from my GP later that afternoon to inform me that it had detected a thickening of womb lining. Yesterday I had a consultation with a gynaecologist and a colonoscopy/biopsy and have been referred for the hysteroscopy. 1st question why a Colonoscopy? isn’t this for the cervix. I didn’t even have time to ask this ! 
 She spent ALOT of time talking about the HRT I’m taking and what my options for HRT are in the future ! She said my endometrium is 9mm but could be because of the HRT. She spoke very quickly and wouldn’t allow me to record the discussion saying I could take notes. 
Everyone was lovely and kind but I never got to ask any questions. How do you retain some control over these consultations? I don’t want come across as difficult but I need some reassurance and I’m no clearer on the likelihood or not that this is cancer. I know you have to take one step at a time but I’m terrified 
Any advice/experiences would be greatly appreciated. Has anyone else had the colonoscopy and then the hysteroscopy?

I find myself reaching out to you wonderful people yet again but on a different topic. I apologise for the rambling post but I hope someone will read through and reply 
I'm not sure where my head is at - scared stiff 1 minute, calm and collected the next  I have a fantastic husband and daughter, parents and 3 amazing friends I can call upon but noone quite gets how I'm feeling. They all say what they think I want to hear rather than what I need to hear. And that is why I find myself here - again.
I was diagnosed with high grade DCIS in my boob 2 years ago for which I had to have a mastectomy and ""luckily"" (I use the term lightly as I don't think luck comes into it really), no other treatment.
I've recently had a very heavy post menopausal bleed for which my GP was fab and sent me for an external and internal ultrasound within a few days.  That showed no other obvious abnormalities apart from thickening of my uterius - 6mm. 
The Sonographer said anything over 4mm had to be referred for further tests, so here I am. Waiting for an appointment for a hysteroscopy. She did also say that just because it was thicker, it didn't mean it was anything sinister.
(After reading other posts on here, my 6mm, although abnormal, seems quite small compared to other ladies' readings. I've seen some of 12mm, even 20mm)
She sent me away with a leaflet explaining the hysteroscopy procedure and nothing else. I've therefore been trying to find out what it actually all means. I only ever trust the NHS web pages or Macmillan/Cancer UK etc pages. 
At best, I may need hormone treatment, at worst a hysterectomy. Either way, it looks like something can be done.
I didn't think I had any other symptoms but looking back, I have put on a few pounds in weight, I feel more tired than normal and my moods are up and down. I thought all of them were down to the menopause. Maybe they are ‍♀️

womb,Question,SFW 24,Awaiting results,"
Hi Ladies
Feeling like a bit of fraud here, I'm awaiting my first biopsy result done last Wednesday after a TVS showed the womb thicker than it should be.  Scan showed no other causes for concern.
However, I wanted to ask what other symptoms you all experienced before your diagnoses.  I started with feeling bloated, noticing discomfort in a couple of yoga positions that were normally fine (opening legs around pelvic area).  THen I had a bleed which followed with the pinky/brownish discharge.  AT that point I contacted the GP and here we are.
I've had more small amounts of spotting and light discharge but a lot of pelvic discomfort and pain.  I feel very bloated, peeing more often and if I need to poo, well!  I remember that being the same back in the day of periods.
I'm 57, I am overweight and I'm 4 years + in menopause.  Been on HRT always with progesterone.
Its hard not to imagine things, but I genuinely feel really uncomfortable and tired.  Is this just the hormonal imbalance?  The symptoms for womb cancer seem to just be the bleeding, did you find that to be true for you?
Just wanted to say that MacMillan are supporting my Dad with terminal cancer and you are all amazing. xx

womb,Sharing positive experience,MarmiteFan59,Demystifying Brachytherapy! Let’s share positive experiences!,"
Most women who have had endometrial cancer and are are offered brachy are given outpatient appointments where the treatment lasts on average 6 minutes. A few, and it is only a few, may be offered a more intensive treatment which takes longer, and can involve an overnight stay. That is normally a treatment for cervical cancer but one or two on the group have had it for endometrial. I had the short treatment and it was a breeze. I was diagnosed in Nov 21, had a hysterectomy in Jan 22 and results said a “technical” stage 2 due to a few cells being found on top of the cervix. I had 25 x radio April-May and 2 x brachy just before the end of my radio treatment. I’m putting this thread up to share about how it was for me and to give others a chance to share their experiences too. My radio and brachy was “an insurance policy” - to minimise the chance of recurrence - so not absolutely necessary but wise. I was aware that recurrence of endometrial cancer is most common within the first 2 years, and that the most common site for recurrence is at the top of the vaginal vault where the cervix used to be, so I wanted to give myself the best chance with external radio to cover any stray cells that might be in my lymph nodes, and brachy to cover my ex-cervix.  
Just over half way through my radio, I was given an appointment for an in-person chat with a brachy nurse at which she explained it all, gave me a leaflet and my pack of dilators, and I had a chance to ask questions. I had had a bit of a wobble about brachy a few days before this and asked my CNS some questions - what she did was arrange for a brachy nurse to phone me that day - she did, was lovely, reassured me heaps, and it also helped because it meant I’d spoken to one of the team who I’d be seeing. A week later I had my very quick mini CT to gauge the size I am inside so that they’d know which size applicator to try. Once they’d checked, the nurse very gently inserted the small applicator with some lubricant (which I think was barely the size of a Tampax applicator - felt like it anyway) and asked me how it felt. At any time I could have said stop and they would have. Some hospitals do the first treatment at this appointment too, but at Southampton they do treatments at separate appointments from the CT one, so I was given two further appointments - one the following week and one the week after (with my two final radios in the two days after that).
I was a bit nervous on treatment day, and even though I’d driven myself to and from all my radio appointments, I asked my husband to take me to this one just in case. I needn’t have worried! I arrived for my appointment, went straight in with no waiting (unlike radio appointments), and was shown to a quiet private room that was gently not brightly lit. I got changed behind a curtain and the nurses were very kind and gentle. They explained what would happen, that there’d be music, and that even though they wouldn’t be in the room they’d be able to hear me if I needed anything and called out. The small applicator was inserted, they left the room and the music went on - two songs later (so approx 6 mins) and it was all done. I wiped myself to remove the gel, got changed and left. I was in and out in about half an hour in all. The second appointment went just as smoothly. I’d honestly rather have had brachy than radio any day. Minor side effect was that after my first treatment, my pee was a bit warm for the first 24 hours. But that was it. 
Feel free to ask me any questions at all - I’m not shy! And please do also share your own positive experiences, to help encourage those on the group who have been offered this treatment and may be feeling unsure.

I finished my treatment at the end of January and I have my first check up on Monday. I haven't been using my dilators so thought I would try today.  I can comfortably only use the smallest size. Will that be enough for an internal examination?

Hi to all you wonderful courageous women, yes I have decided that is what we all are, now that embarrassing part of my thoughts system is out in the open  I have a question regarding the above symptoms.
I am now about 13 weeks post operative, my medical type history is that I started my periods at 12 years old had a terrible time heavy irregular periods with fainting episodes then advancing onto my twenties I had pre-cancerous cells of the cervix so that was delt with then I was diagnosed with polycystic ovaries also in my twenties, advancing into my thirties we were having issues getting pregnant so needed assistance and had several miscarriages but ended up with a beautiful daughter, advancing into my forties and fifties I had always asked my GP's to check if I was going through the dreaded menopause as I was never sure due to Polycystic ovaries and irregular heavy bleeding with clots but more so when in my late forties or nearer my fifties I had a series of miner Hemorrhages (really heavy large clot bleeding without warning) anyway the GP's never done the job although my family history suggested early menopause within the family, I never had any night sweats or hot flushes and everything else that came along with the menopause but since my operation I have had 
Night sweats I am absolutely soaked in the morning, fortunately not every night thank god but at one point I thought perhaps I have an infection on the boil somewhere that is not fully coming to the boil ??? another issue is feeling warm sometimes during the day (remember I live in Scotland so not much sunny days compared to South of the border) difficulty sleeping sometimes I can't sleep at all or I can sleep nearly a full 24hrs, my mood is up and down like a bloody jack in the box and at times I feel anxious but I don't know why my main worrie is regarding my recent problem with memory and concentration at the moment I just can't seem to hold onto something I have been told say a couple days before or getting the bloody days mixed up. ( Some of you ladies no I am a retired Mental Health Nurse and perhaps you guess what I am worried about).
Does anyone think due to my large doses of progesterone 5 tablets 3 times a day and the progesterone coil in I am having menopausal type symptoms because I was taken off the progesterone the next day after my operation, I have reframed from doctor Google but also do not want to contact the GP Surgery over such a little matter, any ideas are welcome as usual and always invaluable to me. Take care Williamina xx

I am now about 13 weeks post operative, my medical type history is that I started my periods at 12 years old had a terrible time heavy irregular periods with fainting episodes then advancing onto my twenties I had pre-cancerous cells of the cervix so that was delt with then I was diagnosed with polycystic ovaries also in my twenties, advancing into my thirties we were having issues getting pregnant so needed assistance and had several miscarriages but ended up with a beautiful daughter, advancing into my forties and fifties I had always asked my GP's to check if I was going through the dreaded menopause as I was never sure due to Polycystic ovaries and irregular heavy bleeding with clots but more so when in my late forties or nearer my fifties I had a series of miner Hemorrhages (really heavy large clot bleeding without warning) anyway the GP's never done the job although my family history suggested early menopause within the family, I never had any night sweats or hot flushes and everything else that came along with the menopause but since my operation I have had 
Night sweats I am absolutely soaked in the morning, fortunately not every night thank god but at one point I thought perhaps I have an infection on the boil somewhere that is not fully coming to the boil ??? another issue is feeling warm sometimes during the day (remember I live in Scotland so not much sunny days compared to South of the border) difficulty sleeping sometimes I can't sleep at all or I can sleep nearly a full 24hrs, my mood is up and down like a bloody jack in the box and at times I feel anxious but I don't know why my main worrie is regarding my recent problem with memory and concentration at the moment I just can't seem to hold onto something I have been told say a couple days before or getting the bloody days mixed up. ( Some of you ladies no I am a retired Mental Health Nurse and perhaps you guess what I am worried about).
Does anyone think due to my large doses of progesterone 5 tablets 3 times a day and the progesterone coil in I am having menopausal type symptoms because I was taken off the progesterone the next day after my operation, I have reframed from doctor Google but also do not want to contact the GP Surgery over such a little matter, any ideas are welcome as usual and always invaluable to me. Take care Williamina xx

womb,Question,Hallie90,3 large fibroids with abnormalities,"
Hi, this is a bit of a long story so apologies. 
A few months ago I had an MRI of my lower back for back pain. They mentioned in the report they saw a large 8cm by 9cm fibroid and I was referred to gynaecology. I then had an ultrasound where they actually found 2 smaller fibroids of around 5cm and decided that wasn't causing the back pain but decided to do a pelvic MRI just to check what the first MRI report was referring to (there was only a report no images, so they thought maybe they'd just measured my womb).
I just had the results back today and I am shocked that instead of one large fibroid or even the two smaller ones. I actually have three large fibroids (ranging from 7 to 10cm) and she mentioned that they showed degeneration and abnormalities? I've been scheduled for keyhole surgery to remove them in just a few weeks and she said they will biopsy them after the surgery.
But I think maybe I didn't ask enough questions because now I'm just confused. They're all on the outside of my womb but then everything I'm reading online says if it does turn out to be cancerous that I shouldn't be having key hole because chopping them Jo for lack of a better term can make it spread. 
I guess I'm just wondering if anyone has had anything similar? 
I literally have no other symptoms other than back pain and constipation. I wasn't expecting to have her say any of that. I just thought she'd say the ultrasound was right and the first MRI was a mistake. I'm 33 if that's of any interest and very lucky that I have private health care with work.

I know when I was Googling womb cancer  (before I got my diagnosis)  it said it was a very rare cancer with a poor prognosis. I have resisted googling since. Just wondered if anyone on this forum has been diagnosed with or knows about this cancer. I would rather hear from the horses mouth so to speak than risk asking Dr Google. I

I have recently had a Pelvic scan which came back abnormal showing 16mm endometrial thickness along with a 68mm fibroid. I have also had a hysteroscopy with a Pipelle Biospy, currently waiting on the results.
My worry is that after al this suffering on a daily basis that is affecting my daily life & work if the biopsy came back normal? My consultant did advise that we can consider a hysterectomy. I didn't realise I was stressing or having anxiety until i am constantly my NHS app and googling everything.
Does anyone have any advice that is going through this to?

My question is has anyone on here been able to get an MRI and CT scan appointment booked before the biopsy results are received? rather than waiting for them and then booking them in afterward I kind of wonder if getting on with that would be something they would consider.

I had my first Paclitaxel and Carboplatin chemo back in June 2024, I was fine after the first session, no problems really apart from bit of hair loss despite having the cool cap.  However, 3 weeks later when I had my second treatment as soon as I was connected to Paclitaxel I have developed a strong allergic reaction - it started with strong back pain moving to my chest and my face went bright read - so the nurse said.  I was disconnected straight away and felt really cold all over.  The nurses made sure my blood pressure and temperature were ok before they send me home.  I was told to come back next day for the Carboplatin only.  I have three more sessions of Carboplatin left.  Just wonder if anybody else had similar reaction?

womb,Question,Knottlagirl,Immunotherapy no longer working,"
Following a recurrence of endometrial cancer and a further course of chemotherapy (which I had a reaction to after cycle 5) I have been receiving pembrolizumab and lenvatinib since September 2023. The side effects were pretty tough so my daily lenvatinib dose (tablets) was halved. Whilst this eased the side effects the efficacy was reduced, resulting in my latest scan showing 3 new small (1cm) spots on my liver. My consultant has asked me to now consider my position given the treatment is no longer working (existing disease stable but new lesions/spots appeared).
If I continue treatment the side effects could potentially be worse, perforated bowel is an example, and my consultant is concerned about the quality of life I will have. This is very important to me. 
I knew this time would come but hadn't expected it to be just yet. There are lots of things I need to consider and weigh up before I next see my consultant on the 19th, when we will make a decision. I'm just wondering if anyone else has been in the same or a similar situation, particularly where treatment has continued past 12 months. From trial data, apparently 12 months is the time patients no longer responding to treatment experienced these potentially worse side effects.

womb,Question,Wise Owl 26,MRI rationale,"
I am 65 and have had some cyclical post menopausal spotting for a couple of days for the last 3 months. A trans vaginal scan revealed an endometrial lining of 20mm. I have  had a hysteroscopy last week, where the doctor removed 1 polyp and did a biopsy. She said before the procedure that she might fit me with a coil, but she ended up prescribing progesterone tablets. She said the lining was  20mm mostly on one side and sent me for an MRI scan, which I had last week.  My question is, what is the rationale for an MRI scan? Is it done ONLY when cancer is strongly suspected to check if it’s spread and it’s grade. Or can an MRI scan be considered an exploratory procedure to help ascertain IF cancer is present? Thanks!

I started to lose weight and have reduced from a bmi of 42 to 36.7. I saw my consultant and she said because of the distribution of fat on mostly my stomach area is would be impossible to do surgery. I queried this and have been to see a different consultant who is willing to do the surgery but warned it may need to be converted to open surgery and that would be difficult to recover from. The coil only made a partial improvement in the biopsy. I have lost 3 stone and I’m now just over 16st. I would like to hear from ladies who have had laparoscopic surgery who are around the same weight as me or bigger. I really don’t know whether to have 3 month biopsies and keep trying to lose weight or to go for it. Thanks for listening.

womb,Question,Rosiesmum,Mum in eighties undecided about treatment,"
My lovely mum is a young active 84 (85 next month) year old. She began bleeding in March and was diagnosed with endometrial cancer. She had a hysterectomy by keyhole in May - 6 weeks ago now and has recovered really really well. 
Histology showed it was stage 1A and no cancer in any of the many lymph nodes they removed. However the type of cancer is grade 3 carcinasarcoma. For this reason she was referred to oncology to discuss mop up prevention treatment. 
we saw a lovely oncologist on Tuesday who talked at length and in great detail of her options. To be honest we were overwhelmed with information! Option 1 was chemo which he didn’t recommend at mums age and with her lung condition ( she has lung fibrosis) he felt it would be too brutal at her age and further affect her lung condition. Option 2 was pelvic radio which he outlined lots of side effects on the bowel and bladder - some lasting and option 3 internal radio - again side effects and the need to use dilators. My poor mum was blown away and frankly scared by all this. We have been given booklets and have another appointment next week to let him know her decision.
She is thinking she wants no treatment just regular check ups. She feels she has a good quality of life currently and wants  to maintain this as long as possible without all this intrusive treatment which may well leave her with a worse and lasting quality of life. In other words she will take her chances. 
As an only child I’m finding this hard - I’ve read the literature and feel to be honest that I should respect her decision and let her enjoy the time she has now. Ideally she says she would like a  few more years then is happy to go see my dad - who we lost to dementia 18 months ago

womb,Question,Hopefulcub,Mum's diagnosis after hysteroscopy,"
Hello all, 
My mum had a hysteroscopy two weeks ago, last week she was called into see the consultant and was told that cancer is present. 
When asked 'what stage?' he said '1-2'. Then proceeded to describe the other stages if it has spread etc. 
He then referred her for an MRI (next week) to see if it's spread anywhere. 
She's 59, her menopause started around 52. She had put all her symptoms down to the menopause, but is now reflecting and convincing herself that it's spread all over her body. 
Obviously we are terrified and really anxious. We've lost close family members to cancer so it's very triggering, as it is for many of us. And as humans we often jump to the worst case scenario. 
Can the consultant actually decipher 'stage 1-2' from biopsy results before an MRI? 
Any stories of hope would be really, really appreciated right now. Thank you all x

Any stories of hope would be really, really appreciated right now. Thank you all x

womb,Question,Eliza04,Need a little advice,"
Hi everyone was on here a few months ago after we found out my mum had incurable womb cancer . ..so palliative treatment was the plan which was meant to be surgery to remove the mass an wotever else ..this never happened the surgeon said he couldn't do it coz she would of bled out and they couldn't risk it . So it was back to another MDT meeting an now palliative chemo is being planned . I am so traumatised by this whole experience because on top of all this shes had blood transfusion after transfusion because her HB levels were dangerously low an they then found a perforated in her stomach which they think was not helping the anemia . However she is eating better since this has been sorted atleast I am just distraught I don't know if I should be preparing for the worst or being positive that shes still here and fighting since April with no treatment.  Any feedback would be so helpful at  this stage xx

I have had 19 sessions of radiotherapy and have 6 to go, and this week by the evening time I feel so tired.  I haven’t been too bad at all with side effects, a loose stools, bit of an upset stomach from time to time, but nothing major.  But the tiredness I’m really feeling.
After the sessions were finished, did anyone have any side effects afterwards and if they did how long did they last?

womb,Question,Takayasu,Investigations,"
Hi , I’ve been under Gynae for a few months now . my back story is I was diagnosed with stage 3 bowel cancer and had a resection 3 years ago . Before my diagnosis my periods were awful - heavy painful clots etc but always regular . Because of this I was referred to Gynae who put a coil in and took a biopsy . Biopsy was reported as normal .i bled every day whilst the coil was in and had pain . Sent for ultrasound and was told I had an ovarian cyst . Another few weeks later we decided to remove the coil . All normal for a few days then extreme bleeding and clotting that I ended up in A and E . Gynae then put me on Provea to help with the blood flow - that didn’t work initially but then I did indeed stop . During that time I had another ultrasound . I’ve now had no bleeding since 8th April , I thought this was great ( I’m 52 ) I had my follow up this week and consultant obviously asked how things were luckily I had a timeline of events since the coil was removed . I explained I was suprised I’d had no bleeding since I stopped the provea . She then looked at the ultrasound report and stated oh the lining is thicker than it should be and you also have adenomyosis. She said I’ll need to do another biopsy and get you a hysteroscopy organised . Cancer was mentioned several times . Not I’ll wait and see what biopsy says . She there and then also referred me for a hysterectomy and said if it is cancer than obviously you will follow a different pathway ! I didn’t take offence to the way she spoke ( I know some might of ) I prefer straight talking particularly as I’m still not clear yet from the bowel side of things . I’m beginning to think that I should of been called in a little earlier once that ultrasound report was sent but that’s my only criticism 
sorry it’s so long ….. Has anyone else been told they have Adenomyosis? Alongside a cancer diagnosis? Or infact it was cancer and not Adenomyosis?

womb,Question,JaxN,Referal (again),"
 I was advised to post here I had introduced myself on the welcome page. I have been doing the “Google” thing which i know you shouldn’t do. I had a hysteroscopy biopsy at the beginning of the year and was told it was ok but they couldn’t view all of the uterus or annexa, due to extensive scarring / adhesions. This surprised me as I have never had any uterine surgery or infection. There was no follow up to explain. However this week I have started bleeding again for 7 days now. My GP has referred me back to the hospital. I just have a horrible horrible feeling that something sinister is going on. As well as the bleeding I have period type pain and being 57 that stopped many years ago. I think I convinced myself that because they couldn’t view the uterus they couldn’t see what may have been going on within the scarring g and behind it. Just feel a sense of dread at the moment. x

womb,Advice,Rosalinda,Spotting postmenopausally again – I know what I need to do but can't if that makes any sense,"
So, I've had a failed hysteroscopy ages ago and a more successful one recently. 
When I had the hysteroscopy a polyp was removed and I was told the submucosal fibroid that I've got is stable (between 3 and 4cm so not huge).
Also told I had atrophic endometrium. Consultant said to go back if further issues after polyp removed – hysteroscopy would cover me for 6 months if that makes sense to anyone. (Am editing this because when I had my hysteroscopy a different Consultant said that wasn't the case and I might need to go back sooner even if the new polyps are okay also – bit of a plot spoiler, as yes I had more polyps!!)
Anyway, was good for a while, then light spotting but I decided to wait and see if it settled as not long after the six months rather than go straight back to the GP. Partly, this was because I had too much to process – had three close family (first degree) bereavements in less than a year and still undergoing tests following sibling's sudden death. I lost my driving license because of the cardiac issue – had a history of unexplained faints/blackouts and previously had lot of tests before getting the license back. But, some new symptoms and sibling's sudden death raised the risk profile.
Still waiting to go back and discuss results of genetic tests re sibling. If I have what they think I could have (cardiology) then an op going forwards could be difficult as lot of medications potentially contra-indicated. I've still got multiple tests lined up in coming months to resolve all this. It's something rare, not common. Have also got lung issue, which further complicates things if op needed.
Have been processing so much grief and loss recently.
Also, trying to sort out basic movement issues – appointments to sort out feet and walking issues.
I can't face another hysteroscopy right now. In short, I'm a coward.
I know I did it without GA before – it will have to be without GA given the raised risks of anaesthesia to me personally (re cardiac and lung issues). Plus, I need to sort out some dodgy moles issues.
Am not depressed – I did an on-line questionnaire to check and scored super low.
It's definitely grief and some other issues, really big stuff that needs sorting, plus I'm a carer.
Sometimes, it's hard to know where to start. I'm thinking maybe wait until I got the grief counselling out the way because I got to do that as I'm struggling so much there and then in six weeks go to GP. Because I honestly don't think that alongside the cardiology appointments, MSK etc I can fit anything else in. My brain is so scrambled with it all.
That's only the half of it. 
Not really expecting a reply here, but I needed to vent and try and understand things in a more detached way. Apologies all!
I know this must sound so stupid and silly and ...
I thought everything would all be okay after the polyp was removed and found to be okay and that I could forget everything. I didn't expect discharge and spotting again which would become a bit heavier. It seems trivial alongside other things, but ... 
Too scared to phone the nurses – even though I know I should and would recommend others did so. What a hypocrite!! And yet, I really feel stuck here. Because if they tell me to get things checked out – which is what I think they will say – then I don't feel I can do it quite yet.

womb,Question,gillianc_louise,Surgery Options for Hyperplasia Aytipica,"
Hi all.
I've always suffered from heavy bleeding, and been to A&E multiple times with blood loss. I eventually got diagnosed with a polyp >4.5cm which was removed early last week, along with multiple others. As I had insurance privately I've had results back very quickly and they've said I have hyperplasia aytipica, and in one sample early cancerous cells noted. 
They have recommended a full hysterectomy, however the hospital were very direct in that due to my weight this is a risk to have done, and even privately it seems some reluctance to use general anesthetic and recommending a robotic route. I am a bit overwhelmed at the moment with it all, and of course will do all I can to lose weight (currently 320lbs) but I am so worried that the time this takes, things could get worse. 
I am in my mid 30s so this has been a bit to take in, and I don't know how I should progress. Do I push harder to get it done, or at least ask for a target timeline? 
Appreciate I am very early days so I hope it is ok to ask these questions, if anyone has ever had a similar situation I'd appreciate the advice. 
Thank you.

womb,Question,Amanda35,Awaiting hysteroscopy results,"
Hi everyone, 
My first post here and I guess I'm just looking for somewhere to vent my anxieties! Havnt told anyone in my family yet, don't want to cause any worry. 
I am 42, have 3 children and according to blood results etc am not yet peri-menopausal. I went to the GP at the start of May as I had been on a constant period since the start of March (still going strong now!) Along with cramping and bloating. She did a swab, gave me some TXA and referred my for an ultrasound. Swabs came back fine which was good! 
The USS saw I had a thickened endometrium of 19.6mm and also found a 1.9cm polyp. So I was referred via the 2 week pathway for a hysteroscopy, which I had on Tuesday last week. They took a biopsy of the endometrial lining however couldn't remove the polyp, so I have to go back for that, just waiting on an appointment date. 
Everything I'm reading online is pointing towards my biopsy results likely being a malignancy - Dr Google eh! If I have, then I'm fine with it, just is what it is, but I'm anxious waiting to find out and sick to death of bleeding if I'm being honest!  
I'm just wondering how long I might be waiting for the biopsy results, and if any of you lovely ladies have experienced results like mine? The nurse doing the hysteroscopy was nice enough but didn't really give me very much information unfortunately other than 'we will write to you or give you a call' 

Thankyou for listening to my anxious ramblings! Any advice is welcome xx

womb,Question,RedRo3e,Hysteroscopy,"
Hi
Last week, a consultant informed me that due to a 7mm thickness of the womb lining (I am postmenopausal and on HRT) and persistent spotting, I would need to undergo a hysteroscopy and biopsy. However, the conversation was so rushed that I didn't get the chance to ask if I could have this procedure done under general anaesthesia (GA). I am considering GA because when I was 25, I had a cone biopsy that resulted in complications and over 5 hours of surgery due to excessive bleeding. Additionally, previous procedures in that area have been extremely uncomfortable, especially now as I have a tilted womb that is difficult to access. I was told that I would be notified of the appointment through the post as soon as I am on the pathway, but I'm unsure who to contact to inquire about having GA. Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated.

Hi All,
I’m 38 years old and I have Lynch syndrome.
I have been diagnosed with stage 1A Endometrial cancer back in April. I have been taking Provera 400mg for nearly a month and swapped to Mirena coil since a month. I have been bleeding every day and in pain every day, but mainly in the evening. Has anybody experienced this? I have been offered a conservative approach, as well as total hysterectomy (womb, ovaries, tubes) due to my syndrome with or without embryos freezing. I have excluded the conservative approach because I’m too scared of what can happen during and after a possible pregnancy, so I’m leaning towards the embryos freezing and then the surgery. But everything is so slow, we are nearly at the end of June and I still don’t have dates…I don’t know if I should be worrying and also very worried about the bleeding and pain due to the coil…it seems is normal and to keep monitoring. I really hope things will not progress during this waiting and that of course I’m making the right decision. Anybody with similar scenario? Thanks and good luck all

I found out last week that I had low grade endometrial cancer and what appears to be a 10cm tumor, although by the point I had my Hysteroscopy and the fact that I already had CT and MRI booked in before results came back I knew it was not going to be a favourable outcome.  I understand there regular treatment for this is take everything out and to tell you that you need a Hysterectomy however I do not want to go this route I'm still quite young.  if someone had lung or brain cancer we wouldn't be trying to remove the whole thing as a first option to kill the cancer.  I do not want to cut parts out of my body as I personally feel that I wont be whole and I want to try alternative methods first.  Did anyone else feel like this and try alternative treatment before opting for such a radical method of treatment. 
I am cognisant that this is normally the most successful method to get rid of it and I know my choices are not backed or understood by many a fact I have found when talking to my family which has left me with nobody to talk too as I am currently getting the cold shoulder for not agreeing to what they feel would be best for me, but i am set on trying to keep my womb for as long as I possibly can.

Hi Ladies
I have completed 25 sessions of radiotherapy and since I have finished the treatment, the side effects are worse than when I was receiving it!  Mostly the ‘runs’, stomach pains and feeling like you need to go to the toilet and frightened to pass wind, incase you pass something else!  ( I apologise if I’ve been a bit graphic).
Wondering if anyone else found this.

womb,Question,Ms Viva,Tinnitus/Hearing Issues + Pos Meniere's Disease Post Treatment,"
Hi 
I had 6 sessons Carbotaxol Aug - Nov last year and 25 sessions of external radiotherapy this Jan. This may not be related at all but I'm now have a referral for pos Meniere's Disease as having bad Tinnitus with some hearing loss plus occasional vertigo and nausea. I did have some symptoms before my cancer diagnosis going back to 2017 and it was put down to bad Labyrinthitis and pos menopause symptoms but it's worsened since my treatment. I am waiting for a hearing test and an ENT appointment which have been told could be some time off. At moment I have constant whoosing/buzzing sound and almost complete hearing loss in my left ear (the loss only has started in last 2 weeks). In my right ear there is also Tinnitus at a lower pitch. I saw the GP 5 weeks ago who prescribed me Betahistine tabs that are supposed to help with the inner ear fluid and anti-sickness/Vertigo meds to take when required.  The Betahistine has not made any difference as yet. This issue is far worse now since finishing the cancer treatment and I am curious if anyone else has had issues after Chemo.
Many thanks

Seemed to take a lot of pictures and a lot of whispered discussions about views – they wanted to look to see if edges of things irregular etc. Am hoping it is all okay. Have done some reading and it seems it can be difficult to tell difference between a degenerating fibroid and something much worse. Will need further tests, however. Hopefully, not two hysteroscopies on top of two internal scans... I definitely wasn't expecting to have to be scanned twice today. (They did ask if I minded. What are you meant to say?

womb,Question,Lorna1974,Chemotherapy/ Radiotherapy,"
My hysterectomy on 27 April for womb cancer went well and my consultant is pleased with my recovery and progress.
Following my consultant appointment he’s recommending 6 cycles of chemotherapy followed by brachytherapy.  The tumour was aggressive and histology showed LVSI was noted.
Recovery from the hysterectomy was pretty straightforward but the hard work starts now and the preventative chemo/radiotherapy treatment is going to be so much harder.  My oncology appointment is 4 June and assume treatment will start pretty soon after that.
Does anyone have any advice on what to take to chemo appointment and how their recovery between cycles has been? I know we’re all different but hearing real life experiences would be really useful and help to settle nerves.  How have you balanced chemo with working?

womb,Question,Lorna1974,Chemotherapy/ Radiotherapy,"
My hysterectomy on 27 April for womb cancer went well and my consultant is pleased with my recovery and progress.
Following my consultant appointment he’s recommending 6 cycles of chemotherapy followed by brachytherapy.  The tumour was aggressive and histology showed LVSI was noted.
Recovery from the hysterectomy was pretty straightforward but the hard work starts now and the preventative chemo/radiotherapy treatment is going to be so much harder.  My oncology appointment is 4 June and assume treatment will start pretty soon after that.

womb,Question,Larn86,37 and diagnosed with womb cancer stage 1,"
Hi guys.
so Im very new here and reading all your posts has made me feel like this is a safe space and be comfortable with any emotion I may be feeling. I have this week been diagnosed with stage 1 (very thank full it’s been caught early) womb cancer. IM not shocked or surprised as we all know when something isn’t rite with our own body however I am upset at the amount of time it’s taken specialist to listen to me and take me seriously, 
So I’m now at the point where i am waiting for an mri appointment told this would be taking place within 14 days. However im Not going to hold my breath as they said I would receive a phone call by Friday it’s now Sunday and no phone call. 
How long between having the mri scan and then the discussion on treatment have people experienced? I was tolD I will need a full hysterectomy including removal of ovaries and cervix. Just the waiting game I hate. 
trying to stay strong for hubby and my little one is increasingly wearing thin though. My little man doesn’t know mommy has cancer just that she’s got to have an operation. thanks

I am now stuck in a nightmare decision with regards to preserving my fertility (if possible) and am waiting to see an oncologist.

womb,Question,SJ1,"Hysteroscopy, growth removed, Mirena coil and nausea","
Hi

During a hysteroscopy under Local Anaesthetic in December 2023, my gynaecologist found a growth in my womb along with 5 or 6 fibroids. She wanted to remove the growth there-and-then but my blood pressure plummeted so the procedure was stopped. The pain was horrendous.  I was moved to the recovery room and remained there for around an hour until my blood pressure returned to normal. Apparently my body had gone into cervical shock. 

As a result, I was referred to have a hysteroscopy under General Anaesthetic (on Friday 3 May) to remove the growth, get a biopsy of it, and remove the fibroids. 

A short time after my arrival at the hospital the anaesthetist asked me to consider a spinal anaesthetic because of my weight. I’d been for a pre operative assessment in January 2024, so it was rather a shock that they waited until an hour before my procedure to suggest I agree to a spinal rather than general anaesthetic.  When an anaesthetist starts talking about the risks of a GA to someone of my size I didn’t feel I had any choice but to agree to the spinal anaesthetic.

After he left the room I was visited by a member of the surgical team who suggested I should get a Mirena coil inserted while under the anaesthetic. I said that I had told the gynaecologist that I wasn’t keen on the Mirena coil, however the surgeon said that it the growth proved to be pre cancerous their first course of action would be to insert a Mirena coil. Again, I didn’t feel I had any choice but to agree to their suggestion. 

I was wide awake in the theatre but I was totally numb from the waist down so I didn’t feel a thing.  Everything went well.  I was told I should get the results of the biopsy within three to four weeks. 

Unfortunately since the procedure I’ve had constant nausea.  I was on Dihydrocodeine for pain relief which I stopped taking last week. I phoned my GP on Monday 13 May because I’m still feeling nauseous. He gave me Prochlorperazine because he thinks I’ve got post operative nausea.  I’m wondering if anyone has had a similar experience. I asked if it could be a side effect of the implant but he thinks not. I appreciate everyone is different but wondered if anyone has had a similar experience?

Would any cancer in the uterus show up on an MRI?

Just wondering as I was diagnosed and had surgery for ovarian cancer in February. From around October my periods have been either non-existent or extremely light. Sometimes there has been the odd bleed in between the what should be the ""normal cycle"".
I had a normal period in January and one whilst I was in hospital in Feb - not as heavy as usual. Last month's was barely anything so April's was even worse. Now I've got random bleeding that's come 9 days before my next period is due.
The CNS knows about the issues (not the last couple of months as I haven't seen her) and she said she'd made a note and the gynae-oncologist would see it but there's no obvious causes for concern etc. 
I had an MRI at the end of April and there's nothing reported on there that shows any concerns about the uterus - in fact according to my GP, it reports ""no evidence of residual disease"".
Is this just a coincidence / maybe stress related? Only the right ovary was removed - it's currently unstaged and believed to be only stage 1, but this can't be confirmed as the surgeon who removed the tumour didn't take other biopsies from other areas etc. It was an endometrioid ovarian adenocarcinoma which I know can also be in the uterus but, as I say, it doesn't appear as though anything has flagged up on the MRI which it presumably would if there were any cancer cells significant enough to be causing these issues?

womb,Question,Sorrell,No further treatment,"
Hi
I was wondering about the variation in giving further treatment for stage 1a high grade cancer following hysterectomy.
I had serous type cancer found in a small polyp after hysteroscopy. So stage 1a. After hysterectomy nothing else was found so it remained 1a. The surgeon gave me the news over the phone whilst I was out so I couldn't really ask any questions. The letter I received stated that everything had been removed before I even had the hysterectomy, at the time I had the hysteroscopy.

womb,Question,Sorrell,No further treatment,"
Hi
I was wondering about the variation in giving further treatment for stage 1a high grade cancer following hysterectomy.
I had serous type cancer found in a small polyp after hysteroscopy. So stage 1a. After hysterectomy nothing else was found so it remained 1a. The surgeon gave me the news over the phone whilst I was out so I couldn't really ask any questions. The letter I received stated that everything had been removed before I even had the hysterectomy, at the time I had the hysteroscopy.
I have a follow up appointment in July but I haven't had a chance to talk to anyone about the results.i have requested this,  but no- one has contacted me.

womb,Question,Ange19,Radiotherapy,"
Hi I am due to start radiotherapy on Thursday this week, and wondering how it effected your day to day life.  
Could you still manage to go out or did it effect your bowels/bladder so that it was difficult to go out?  Or was it too tiring to do much and did it make anyone feel poorly?
Just wanting a bit of an idea, as I know when I had chemotherapy I felt quite poorly for a week or so and then gradually felt better.
Thanks in advance.

womb,Question,SuzieSue,Pelvic Pain 8 weeks after robotic hysterectomy,"
Hi all,
I have grade1A endometrial cancer, and had a robotic hysterectomy in March this year. The treatment and staff have been fantastic and the operation went well. Unluckily I then 2 weeks later had a vaginal sutures infection. Treated with inpatient and then outpatient antibiotics. A CT scan showed no breakdown of the scar.
I was really set back with my recovery but am slowly improving again and less tired. I am now 8 weeks post op and my question is about pelvic pain. It is uncomfortable most of the time, and if I do any activity such as standing too long, or too much housework, I get pelvic pain and have to lie down and rest. I have tried very gently increasing my activity and am not pushing it very much but am unsure if this within the range of normal as so many people seem to say they are back to normal at 4 or 6 weeks? My CNS nurse has said be patient, but I am worried that maybe I have adhesions? Have any of you had similar experiences and will it get better! 

*Update 9 weeks post op* For those reading this who have had pelvic pain lingering post hysterectomy too, this week is already much less painful so I am hopeful that I just wasn't being patient enough and just had to give it time! 
Thanks,
Suzie

Hi, I'm 65. I had a transvaginal scan 2 weeks ago which showed a suspicious area of thickened endometrium 9mm x 13mm x 13mm and fluid filled areas. Referred with 'suspected endometrial cancer' under 2 week process.
Went for a Hysteroscopy today and it was so painful that she couldn't do the biopsies. Doctor said my cervix was 'atrophied' ?! which could explain the pain. She did manage to do the imaging and said she could see quite a large polyp but she couldn't do a biopsy. I now have to wait 4-6 weeks to have the polyp removed and sent off and for endometrial biopsies, with a general anaesthetic. I feel such a failure and a wuss. And I now have to wait again with possible cancer. I'm so cross with myself but the cramping pain really was intolerable. I was shaking afterwards and felt so nauseous. I even shed some tears.

womb,Question,catsandtrees,Total hysterectomy and BSO booked but still confused by symptoms,"
Hi all, 
So had a good long chat with the consultant on 25th April following the hysteroscopy on 6th April for post menopausal bleeding with cramping and pelvic pain. He said benign changes and scarring which he has no explanation for, only 1 cervical polyp and no signs of any cancer etc.  He went through some options for the ongoing pelvic pain/cramping etc, do nothing, versus continuing analgesia, versus a gastroenterology opinion, versus having a bilateral salpingo oophorectomy which he suggested would not have much benefit, as well as a total laparoscopic hysterectomy +/-bilateral salpingo oophorectomy. Further changes to my HRT could also be considered to see whether symptoms get better.
We asked him which he would recommend, he said total laparoscopic hysterectomy + bilateral salpingo oophorectomy which will be keyhole and not robotic. Everything will then get sent off to the lab to double check for anything sinister. 
So this is now booked in for 22nd May. 
Today have had more spotting and there appears to be little bits of something that has been expelled in my wee, TMI I know. They sunk to the bottom of the toilet bowl. Just stringy bits of who knows what. Stomach cramping continues as does the pelvic pain and lower back ache.
So clearly it was not the polyp causing this. No cancer found in the polyp or biopsies. Consultant confident that the hysterectomy will solve the symptoms but I cannot help but be worried that there may be something sinister hidden away which will be found once they send everything off to the lab.
I have tried to find any research papers of negative hysteroscopy results for cancer turning into positive hysterectomy results for cancer if you know what I mean but cannot find anything.
It’s so frustrating. Something has to be causing these ongoing symptoms but if my consultant oncology gynaecologist does not know then who will?
Just wondered if anyone was in a similar position prior to their diagnosis?

Hey everyone. My time is nearly upon me, my hysterectomy is booked for tomorrow (atypical hyperplasia with suspicion of early cancer but not confirmed).

She said previous surgery makes keyhole much more difficult, but she would try. Does anyone have any success stories in a similar scenario?

womb,Question,Glass Not Full,Menstrual Cycle,"
was diagnosed with endometrioid ovarian adenocarcinoma and had a 15cm tumour removed in February.
I was diagnosed in November - I hadn’t had a proper period then, or a period at all in December. It returned to normal in January but had a very light one in Feb, last month and now this month.
The surgeon says all the tumour was removed - and it was just the tumour and one ovary (it wasn’t identified so they presume the tumour must have engulfed it). CA125 is back to a normal level.
The cancer is currently unstaged as the oncologist wants to take me back to theatre to check for any signs of spread (the surgeon says there were no visible signs in Feb) and take biopsies and tissue samples etc if necessary.
Just wondering if there is a connection between the periods and the cancer?
My CNS says it’s probably stress related and she may be right although the first light period was in November before I knew there was anything wrong…

I finished 25 sessions of external pelvic radiotherapy 11 weeks ago. The bowel side effects have calmed down and bladder effects there but manageable. But finding achy hips and lower back annoying and taking regular painkillers for it. Did talk to my CNS a month ago who said to take those and that hopefully it will be a temp thing. I have my first 3 monthly check in 2 weeks so will discuss it with the Radiotherapy Dr then but would like any feedback from anyone who's experienced bad hip and back ache and whether they have needed further tests such as a bone scan.

womb,Question,Samlet,"Awaiting results, patience vibes please","
Hello. I am new here and not even sure if I should be.
I went to my GP with unexplained and unusual bleeding (I am in Perimenopause and on HRT) who referred me for an ultrasound. The sonographer said it all looked fine to him so I thought that was that but then I had a hysteroscopy appointment come through. Hysteroscopy showed a large growth area at the back so the consultant has done a biopsy and I am waiting for results of that.
I have read the whole of the internet so I am fairly sure what the three possible outcomes are likely to be, I just want to *know* so I can deal with whatever that is. It' s been over 2 weeks now waiting for the results. I can't call anyone to ask and I just don't know how to continue waiting. Does anyone have any tips?

womb,Question,Penny55,Life after getting the all clear,"
Hello lovely ladies.
I hope you are all ok?
I finished my chemo and radiotherapy a couple of months ago and have been told that I am now cancer free as far as they can tell.
I know I should be feeling relieved and grateful for this news but I find myself thinking about reoccurrence and life expectancy.  Is it normal to feel this way? I live alone and try to keep busy when I can but it's at night when I can't sleep that these thoughts take over.
I have an appointment with my oncologist this week but haven't heard from anyone at the hospital since my treatment ended two months ago. I thought my CNS may have checked in but she hasn't and I can't help feeling a bit disappointed by this. Does anyone else feel a bit abandoned since finishing treatment?
One last thing - I've been left with peripheral neuropathy in my feet and very dry, sore and itchy skin on my shins. I'm taking medication for the neuropathy and trying all sorts of creams for my legs but nothing appears to be helping yet. Is anyone else struggling with their feet and skin? Is it likely to improve with time? I will speak to my oncologist about this but thought I would ask how you coped with this?
Thank you for taking the time to read this. I have friends to talk to but I know you all understand what it's like and I'm just feeling a bit down about everything. 
Thank you.

I'm still doing physio for previous health problems, so when I go next week I'm going to ask about exercise etc. that I can do to get myself strong and ready for the surgery. 
I'm in a decent position because I actually feel quite well at the moment and I'm not bleeding anymore due to my IUD. So I have the energy to do things and the time as well.

I have found out recently that I am to have external radiotherapy, 25 times over 5 weeks.  I spoke to the radio therapist who said I wouldn’t be able to drive myself and would need lifts, she said I would be too tired and fatigued to drive.  
i was wondering if anyone who has had radiotherapy drove to their appointments, also she said I need to have a CT scan and an MRI scan, I have had an MRI scan before but do not like them as I am slightly closthphobic (not sure how to spell this)!  Did anyone have to have both or just a CT scan?
How did it make you feel during the radiotherapy, we’re you able to do most things?
Thanks
Ange

womb,Question,NJT93,Looking for others of similar age (30) going through tests etc,"
I'm currently waiting for the results of biopsies after a hysteroscopy last week due to a thickened endometrial lining and non stop bleeding for 4 months.
Of course, I have turned to Google but I'm struggling to find anything about women my age going through this.
I'm trying to stop myself worrying as the likelihood is everything will be fine, but I really can't concentrate at work and the waiting is driving me mad.
I'd love to hear others experiences if possible, need to know I'm not alone.

womb,Question,Jay1977,3cm x 3cm polyp,"
Hello all. I hope you don’t mind me posting - I feel a bit silly as I don’t have any confirmation of anything right now!

I am 46 and have had AUB for around 6 years. Periods getting progressively heavier and longer. I went on to combined HRT a year ago hoping it would calm bleeding down but it didn’t. Had ultrasound scan that showed endometrial thickness of 20.5mm, and a 2cm x 1cm polyp. Booked in for hysteroscopy, coil and polyp removal which happened about ten days ago. Have since had doc report saying the polyp was 3cm x 3cm. Should this be a worrying sign? Quick google search suggests most uterine polyps are smaller than this. Doc booked a follow up appt for 4 weeks from date of procedure so around 2.5 weeks to wait. 
Anyone else’s experience with large polyps greatly appreciated. Just want to prepare myself if this is something I should potentially worry about.
Tthank you!

womb,Question,Eve1064,Ultrasound says further investigation needed but when ??,"
Hi ,I’m 53 post menopausal ,had partial hysterectomy 9 years ago due to heavy periods .Ovaries and cervix kept .Around 3 years later started having menopause symptoms but covid and was worried about HRT but they slowly got worse especially the fatigue and no energy so thought give HRT a go .Been on estrogen gel and in last year testosterone which helped with joint pain,night sweats but still no energy ,fatigue ,badder and bowel trouble and in last few months severe pelvic pain and a clear discharge but now it’s pink .
Kept going to doc told ibs ,uti even sleep apnea and insomnia due to trouble sleeping until a different doc examined me and referred me for ultrasound and did the ca125 which came back at 27 which is within normal range .The radiographer said I would be referred gynae as I had a thickened endometrial lining and bulky cervical stump .Doc phoned said an urgent ct scan had been requested and gynae would be in touch .That  two weeks ago .I said I thought I didn’t have a uterus and was told residual endometrial lining had been left during hysterectomy and that I have endometriosis (not once was I ever told this in the past or told because of this I should be on progesterone should be taken ) 
sorry for my long winded post but how without biopsy s can they tell as I have all the classic symptoms and to suddenly say due to endometriosis there is about an 8 year wait for diagnosis for this in Scotland so am I to wait years before I get a ct scan and I feel awful I can barely eat without feeling full up ,my stomach is so bloated I look 9 months pregnant and so much pain and no energy but feel like I’m going crazy and docs think I’m a hypochondriac every time I attempt to contact them .
Have a gp calling on Monday am I right in asking why no biopsies being done before a ct scan and that I would like this done sooner rather than later .

womb,Question,Cathy B,Dostarlimab treatment tweak by Consultant,"
Just asking if anyone has had Dostarlimab? I started it in January, and due cycle 4 today, and all the info states that first 4 cycles are 3 weekly, then it goes 6 weekly. 
Yesterday I had my pre cycle 4 telephone review, and the Consultant said she is giving me a cycle 5 in 3 weeks?? I did challenge her and say I was told I was now expecting it to go 6 weekly. She said who told you that?! Well the patient info leaflet did! She said it was her decision. 
Having read every patient info leaflet on line; the Dostarlimab protocol via the company who makes it, and of course NICE guidance, every one says 4 cycles are 3 weekly then 6 weekly.
So cycle 5 is now in April 23rd, My cycle 6 is now planned for June 4th, my 30th wedding anniversary is that day and we will be in Yorkshire having planned it on my 6 week break!
I did ring CNS yesterday but of course it was a bank holiday. 
Has anyone had this extra cycle out of protocol? I am tolerating it really well, but we'll stressed now!

Are these prognosises set in stone? Are they always right?
I am 3C2 and not curable. I didn't ask for my prognosis as I was too scared at the time after one bad news meeting after another. However, I now think I need to as I have lots of things to think about - namely, getting on and enjoying any disease free time I have left after I finish chemo - chemo is working well and I have had an excellent response to treatment according to my consultant. I am drawing down on some personal pensions I have that I could access when I turned 55 in August to pay for two big holidays this year but now also considering taking ill health retirement from the NHS. I will be 56 in August.

Hi there,
Can those of you who have recently had the above let me know if you were allowed to watch the screen, that is if you wanted to at all?
Also, I guess it is case dependant, but does the person who completes the procedure tell you anything straight away? 
If I ask them to tell me the size of the endometrium thickness, do you think they will tell me? 
I am going private, not NHS. I saw the consultant Gyno Oncol chap last Thursday who said i need urgent ultrasounds and a hysteroscopy. What he did not tell me is that he is now on holiday until 4th April. I found this out from his secretary last Friday when I went to book in for the hysteroscopy. So the earliest he will see the results of the ultrasound is 4th April.  
His secretary said last Friday that his first free slot is 21 April but she is working hard to try and get another consultant to give up their theatre time on either 6th or 7th April so my consultant can do the hysteroscopy sooner. 
The 21st is 4 weeks away and then up to 2 weeks for the results. 6 weeks is such a long time to wait for results. 
Hate this waiting game, good only knows what happens if you get a bad diagnosis. Your mind must go into overdrive.
And here I am whining about what could end up being nothing when so many of you are going through huge challenges. I apologise if I am sounding whiny, feeling a bit glum and getting nervous about tomorrow. 

UPDATED 18/3/24
So just had the TV and abdominal ultrasound scans. Fella who did it was lovely as was the last chaperone.  So he said ovaries look good with no cysts, said there is a little something on my cervix which might be a polyp but will need to wait for the hysteroscopy results. He was cagey with the thickness but he eventually said around 6mm but then said as I am on HRT the thickness will need to be interpreted by my consultant. I do not remember anything he said about the uterus as they were asking me loads of question about work and family, probably to keep me calm lol.
So, I now need to wait and must not start googling issues with cervix.
I rang my consultants secretary and told her what was said and said I really want the hysteroscopy asap. Just have to wait to hear back. I have said that I can attend a cancellation at the drop of a hat. For now it is pencilled in for 21st April.

I have just been told that my outlook is better than first thought and I am now being offered five weeks of radiotherapy after chemo (I had my last one on 22 Feb).
Would be interested to hear of others experience of radiotherapy, side effects etc and how long they last. I have a trip booked for 25 April so the radiotherapy will probably start after that - I am seeing the clinical oncologist on Friday. Obviously, I will postpone the trip if he advises radiotherapy needs to start sooner.  I have another trip booked for July. Just wondering if this trip will be doable in any of your experiences.

womb,Question,Maxelyn,Advice re treatment,"
Hi. 
Been on a roller coaster of diagnosis, referred for biopsies mid November, told beg of December Atypical hyperplasia as oncologist said team split 50/50 as to pre-cancer or established cancer.
MRI week later showed established cancer but told not metastatic told needed surgery to remove womb, cervical ovaries, fallopian tubes.  Did pre-op assessment then met surgeon. Cancer re-staged to 1B.
Surgeon. explained everything calmly by diagram and said possibility it had spread to Lymph nodes as cancer had gone over their 2nd marker, will therefore take 4 of the Lymph nodes.
Surgery was mid January, and pathology showed microscopic cancer cells in one of the Lymph nodes only. Cancer Re-staged to 3C1 Cancer and 6 rounds of chemo recommended.
Now 7 weeks postvsurgery dont see Oncologist till Easter week.
Surgeon explained some people don't do Chemo etc as it was so microscopic in the Lymph node and others do full kitchen sink at it as not wanting Cancer back.
I don't want Cancer back, but have so many other complex diagnosis 34 in fact,  Indont think my body can cope with Chemo ....  
What advice do you have for me.  Everyone has reiterated from the hsptl that it was a microscopic cell in the Lymph node and 2 years agonitvwoukd have gone undetected!

womb,Question,Maxelyn,Advice re treatment,"
Hi. 
Been on a roller coaster of diagnosis, referred for biopsies mid November, told beg of December Atypical hyperplasia as oncologist said team split 50/50 as to pre-cancer or established cancer.
MRI week later showed established cancer but told not metastatic told needed surgery to remove womb, cervical ovaries, fallopian tubes.  Did pre-op assessment then met surgeon. Cancer re-staged to 1B.
Surgeon. explained everything calmly by diagram and said possibility it had spread to Lymph nodes as cancer had gone over their 2nd marker, will therefore take 4 of the Lymph nodes.
Surgery was mid January, and pathology showed microscopic cancer cells in one of the Lymph nodes only. Cancer Re-staged to 3C1 Cancer and 6 rounds of chemo recommended.
Now 7 weeks postvsurgery dont see Oncologist till Easter week.
Surgeon explained some people don't do Chemo etc as it was so microscopic in the Lymph node and others do full kitchen sink at it as not wanting Cancer back.
I don't want Cancer back, but have so many other complex diagnosis 34 in fact,  Indont think my body can cope with Chemo ....  
What advice do you have for me.  Everyone has reiterated from the hsptl that it was a microscopic cell in the Lymph node and 2 years agonitvwoukd have gone undetected!

I am due my last session of chemotherapy on 20 March (hopefully), and I believe I am going to have some sort of radiotherapy, I was wondering if any of you had external radiotherapy and brachytherapy, after chemotherapy or do most people have either external or brachytherapy?

So got my results today & thankfully pre cancer biopsy result! As soon as he said pre...I exhaled, didn't even realise I was holding a breath!
Due to history, they want to do full hysterectomy asap. Most of it is a whirlwind, vaguely remember some warnings about sample areas, but I'm confident things won't change after the histology report returns. He did say he'd draft everything in a letter to send GP & and cc me in.They tried to book my pre op today but no availability, so back on Friday & then will get a surgery date within next 4-6 weeks!
Can't quite believe 3 weeks ago my gynaecologist was giving me options to avoid major surgery to today sitting there to hear another one say sooner rather than later would be best! 
I suppose I'm just looking for pre op advice really? Any recovery tips etc. I'm relatively fit & healthy though on meds for hypertension (I'm sure it's related to Adenomyosis but thats another tale) Work have been amazing, home & office based & I can work from home more, once back on my feet. I help out a lot with young grandchildren, (ages 1,4, 6) so more worried about that at the minute. Had laporoscopy a while back & struggled to lift anything for a couple of weeks, expecting similar.

womb,Question,CC,Endometrial lining of 20mm??!!,"
Hi I realize this post is a few years old but I was wondering if anyone has gone through this. I am 32 years old and had a baby 10months ago. I didn’t get a period for the 8months and I assumed it was because I was breastfeeding. I stopped at 8months and immediately started to spot which later became a period. I bled for 10days heavy with clots and it stopped. One week later I had sex and while it wasn’t painful the bleeding started again and has been on for over a month and got heavier for the last one week. I was asked to combine anti inflammatory with a traxenemic (not sure I got the spelling) to stop the bleeding but it just clots the blood and the bleeding is still on. Had an ultrasound done a month ago and my endometrial lining was 20mm before all the heavy bleeding. Had another one done recently and still 20mm. They have me scheduled for a biopsy and hysteroscopy in April but I keep wondering why they can’t bring it forward. Also I have PCOS and I assume it got worse with having a baby and the added weight. Just going crazy over here and hoping to talk to someone thanks.

Hello everyone thinking of you all. Some advice please. 7 weeks post-op and I saw my consultant surgeon yesterday. I am Stage 1A, no lymph node or myometrial invasion, no cancer in the hysterectomy samples at all. It was all in a polyp removed in Dec 2022. The type has finally come back as Grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma and I’ve not been offered any adjuvant treatment, just follow up in 6 months. It’s good news no chemo but I’m scared about a recurrence - I thought all Grade 3 cancers were treated with radiotherapy as a minimum regardless of stage as they are high risk of coming back?

womb,Question,I love cake,hysteroscopy,"
Hi,
I went into hospital in Dec 2022 as my uterus was 4.4 i was 55 and gone through menopause the  results all clear no further action
i went in again in jan 2024 as i had a small bleed in nov 2023  ultra sound showed it was now 6.9 but they said not to worry as they only worry when it gets to 11(i dont want it to get to 11)
just had my results in an this is what it said 
""This patient underwent a hysteroscopy and biopsy under general anaesthetic 23.1.24. This showed an atrophic endometrium and cervix. The histology results support this finding - the sample was scanty with no evidence of neoplasia. No further input is required.""
i guess this makes sense to them but not me ?
Also the pre op nurse asked if i had been offered  the marina coil ? No i had not
I spoke to a nurse on here and she sent me some very good information which also stated that you should be offered coil or the pill i have been offered neither i had no clue until i did my own research,
why have they not informed me ?is this standard to mis out this info twice  ?
i know i should feel relieved ..i think, if i have understood letter, not really too sure,?
i feel i need to see my doctor and even email the surgeon but i dont want to come across as rude, but i want to also try and stop this getting bigger its not even being monitored which the info i got from here said it should be ,
is my hospital failing me ?
i know i asked the first time round if i could just have a hysterectomy but they said no,i asked why it was getting bigger if no polyp or fibrod found they said sometimes being over weight?i am 2 stone over weight,sorry for long post i just need to sound off as i dont like to worry family friends plus they all think i should be happy but im just scared.

i went in again in jan 2024 as i had a small bleed in nov 2023  ultra sound showed it was now 6.9 but they said not to worry as they only worry when it gets to 11(i dont want it to get to 11)
just had my results in an this is what it said 
""This patient underwent a hysteroscopy and biopsy under general anaesthetic 23.1.24. This showed an atrophic endometrium and cervix. The histology results support this finding - the sample was scanty with no evidence of neoplasia. No further input is required.""
i guess this makes sense to them but not me ?
Also the pre op nurse asked if i had been offered  the marina coil ? No i had not
I spoke to a nurse on here and she sent me some very good information which also stated that you should be offered coil or the pill i have been offered neither i had no clue until i did my own research,
why have they not informed me ?is this standard to mis out this info twice  ?
i know i should feel relieved ..i think, if i have understood letter, not really too sure,?
i feel i need to see my doctor and even email the surgeon but i dont want to come across as rude, but i want to also try and stop this getting bigger its not even being monitored which the info i got from here said it should be ,
is my hospital failing me ?
i know i asked the first time round if i could just have a hysterectomy but they said no,i asked why it was getting bigger if no polyp or fibrod found they said sometimes being over weight?i am 2 stone over weight,sorry for long post i just need to sound off as i dont like to worry family friends plus they all think i should be happy but im just scared.
Any advice would be really welcome thanks for taking time if you got this far x

womb,Question,Ange19,Working while having radiotherapy,"
Hi
I am currently undergoing chemotherapy, hopefully have two sessions to go, and may have to have some sort of radiotherapy.  I was just wondering can you manage to work while having external or internal radiotherapy, I don’t know which one I will have, or I may have both.  I do admin, so basically sitting at a computer all day, I also can work from home.  Also with the internal radiotherapy is it done as an inpatient, as I heard that someone had to have it as an inpatient?  Does anyone know how many sessions you typically have of internal radiotherapy and approximately how long does each one last?
Than you

(The chemo nurse said they couldn’t until you got symptoms - but that’s a bit late? And symptoms of what as I don’t have a womb any more.
(context is grade 3 , stage 3 - hysto 4 weeks ago. - did a sentinel node biopsy and showed there was cancer in nodes and LVSI other side) but none of this showed on scan (actually 2 nodes were slightly raised - but I’m not sure if these have now done) - it’s all very unclear and thinking chemo may not be worth it.
any help greatly appreciated as I thin one should know this going into chemo.

womb,Question,Rachart,"Treatment Choices - Chemo, Radio or Immunotherapy","
Hello (Apologies if this has been discussed before).  Basically I’m Grade 3 3C1 recently diagnosed and 3 weeks post radical Hysto.  They are keen to get started on the treatment.  I went to see the Chemo Dr today and the plan is 6 Weeks Chemo (Paclitaxel and Carboplatin), 5 Weeks Radio on pelvic lymph’s and 1 week Bracheo.  This all sounds rather standard from browsing through this excellent resourse.  I have a couple of questions:
1. The Dr said that was the best combination of chemo drugs from last century's research (Has there not been any research / trials done with Chemo in the last 20 years for womb cancer?)
2. I’ve read a lot about Immuotherapy e.g Dostarlimbad - I didn’t really get a clear answer why these are not deployed sooner as they seem more effective.
I think that’s about it for now … but any links or tips on choices are most welcome

2. I’ve read a lot about Immuotherapy e.g Dostarlimbad - I didn’t really get a clear answer why these are not deployed sooner as they seem more effective.
I think that’s about it for now … but any links or tips on choices are most welcome

womb,Question,CiCi24,Treatment options,"
Hi there, 
I'm completely new to this forum. I'm really struggling right now with the uncertainty of my mums treatment and what her options are so I suppose I've reached out on here to see if anyone knows of any other options/trials that are taking place that she can be considered for. 
Background
My mum was diagnosed with endometrial cancer in Nov 2021, she had a full hysterectomy in December 2021. They removed the first sentinel node during the procedure. It showed signs the cancer had spread there but no further spread. She had 6 rounds fo chemo following the op and this was successful. For a year her scans were clear. Then in May 2023 the cancer had returned, all still very localised and they'd caught the changes early again. She had a further 6 rounds of chemo. The scan at the end showed her cancer was 'stable'. Then in December 2023 the routine scan showed some growth so she was offered immunotherapy. She started this in January but has had a very rare reaction to this resulting in being admitted to hopsital in a critical state. She is recovering from this however she can no longer continue on the immunotherapy. Her consultant is due to meet with her in a couple of weeks and have discussed more chemo and potentially radiotherapy but this is all tbd at the MDT meeting.
Naturally I'm so frightened. I'm so close with my mum and cannot bear the thought of life without her, I really wouldn't cope. I've emailed a couple of other trusts for advice/second opinions, I have faith in her consultant but also worry that they're not doing enough for her (but I am an extremely anxious person that worries over everything and I suffer really bad health anxiety myself). You probably can't answer my concerns which I understand but if anyone has heard of anything outside of the above or any trials please let me know.
Thank you  
Xx

womb,Question,Poppy58,Robot surgery,"
Hi everyone
I hope your treatment is going to plan, I would love to hear if anyone is or has had robotic surgery?
I was told on Wednesday I will have a total hysterectomy including cervix, ovaries and fallopian tubes by robotic surgery early in the new year, I felt a bit rushed in my appointment and didn't get to ask many questions as they were keen to send me down for a pre op assessment whilst I was at the hospital that afternoon !!  Can anyone tell me how long the surgery lasts for, what it was like afterwards etc, they said I would normally go home the same day but as I live on my own they may keep me overnight until the morning.. Would I still be on a drip post op, catheter in, packing in the vagina etc. Sorry if these questions are a bit personal but I have read things online and it seems to vary quite a lot on google what will happen - I know I shouldn't google but am between hospitals now for treatment and haven't got a new CNS yet.

womb,Question,Poppy58,Robot surgery,"
Hi everyone
I hope your treatment is going to plan, I would love to hear if anyone is or has had robotic surgery?
I was told on Wednesday I will have a total hysterectomy including cervix, ovaries and fallopian tubes by robotic surgery early in the new year, I felt a bit rushed in my appointment and didn't get to ask many questions as they were keen to send me down for a pre op assessment whilst I was at the hospital that afternoon !!  Can anyone tell me how long the surgery lasts for, what it was like afterwards etc, they said I would normally go home the same day but as I live on my own they may keep me overnight until the morning.. Would I still be on a drip post op, catheter in, packing in the vagina etc. Sorry if these questions are a bit personal but I have read things online and it seems to vary quite a lot on google what will happen - I know I shouldn't google but am between hospitals now for treatment and haven't got a new CNS yet.

womb,Question,WILMA 08,Test Results On 25th January 2024,"
Hi everyone I don't come on that often although I read mostly all the posts, anyway I have been living with my wee Cancer pal for nearly 18 months, I eventually seen the robotics consultant on 14th December 2023 Dr May wasn't too happy about my weight (go figure what new to us fatties ) so he said that he was "" not to happy about the operation as you have to be tipped and all my middle weight would be pressing on my chest"" he then checked when my last scans were, so I was getting new ones due to the last ones being over a year and I was to have an appointment with the anaesthetist.
The anaesthetist was on the 21st December 2023 and she was a right Debbie downer my husband noticed I had zoned out a couple of times and was worried I would just get up and walk out !! In fact I nearly did, the anaesthetist went on and on about my obese weight and that there were high risks to my operation (stroke heart attack death) she also informed me they would have to put a central line and I would be taken to ICU she then rabbled about my weight and that if I didn't have the bad food in the house then I would lose the weight and it's a fight for my health and life she also was getting In touch with diabetic consultant asking about the weight lose injection and my GP about my anxiety and low mood, wouldn't you have anxiety and a low mood whilst living with all the outside issues such as being disabled being obese having diabetes which is very well controlled pain 24/7 that wakes you up and so much more.
The following week I had my MRI & CT scans on 27th December 2023 felt like a square getting pushed into a round whole and that MRI was for fat people and what made it so funny was someone got stuck in it before me so my hubby was telling me. Christmas and New year went kept my worries at bay. I started to worry not long after so I left a message on 16th January 2024  for my useless nurse specialist asking when my results will ready as there had been two MDTM each on Thursday and I new my scans were already in  got a phone call on Friday 19th January 2024 from one of the secretary's from gyna NOT FROM THE NURSE SPECIALIST AS USUAL anyway after the phonecall which gave me an appointment for Thursday 25th 2023 my hands were shaking and I just burst out crying this has never happened to me before especially my hands shaking like a leaf, hubby came over and cuddled me and said "" You are under so much stress I have seen it in you for the last 4 or 5 weeks, Stress about your weight stress about the results stress at not seeing Alysha this year and the pain you are in everyday"". 
SO last weekend I done nothing but binge and make homemade chicken Noddle soups homemade chicken pie with own pastry and no fat cake (jam roll) homemade custard, my hubby says it's brilliant as my cooking is far better than the rubbish you get out the shops lolo I tend to bake when stressed. 
If the Cancer hasn't spread or changed then it buys me more time to loose weight, before the operation but if the Cancer has changed then times up what I would like to know from any of you wonderful ladies is "" WHAT QUESTIONS DO I ASK THE CONSULTANT OF THURSDAY 25th JANUARY 2024"". If anyone knows what to ask please let Me no.
Kind Regards.

I'm hoping someone may have a little bit of advice for me.
I've been fairly fortunate on this cancer journey & was told I was officially cancer free almost 2 weeks ago.

womb,Question,Claireywaireybaby,Stage 3 endo cancer - will I get HRT?,"
Hi folks
I know I should talk to my doctor about this and will but hoped to hear some peoples' experiences...
They originally thought I had stage 1B so I opted to keep ovaries as I'm 39. 
Post surgery biopsy turns out it is stage 3 grade 2 so now it's chemo, surgery to remove ovaries and omentum and radiotherapy. 
I've got a road ahead as I'm only 2 chemo sessions in, and I'm trying to take things one thing at a time
However, in quite daunted by the thought of HRT as it seems really hard to get it right.  And surgical menopause sounds really harsh. I'm even more scared that I won't be allowed to have it or at least for a while incase cancer comes back. 
I also know I'll need maintenance megace too. 
I'm worried I'm going to be stuck between being fat and depressed or the cancer coming back to be honest.  
I'm really missing other people's experiences. My long journey through endometriosis taught me the value of sharing experiences to make sense of things. So I'd be so appreciative if anyone had experiences to share.

I was diagnosed with endometrial cancer in 2020.Had a hysterectomy with follow up brach therapy. Clear of cancer for 3 months but 3 month scan revealed swollen lympnodes pelvic area.
I have had chemo which was successful putting cancer into remission for 6 months but cancer returned. More chemo, 8 months remission.
It's back again and still confined to pelvic area. Have been offered chemo and immunotherapy. Have to decide which treatment to have. My team seem keen on immuno. But having read up on side effects I am hesitant to go with immuno. They can be pretty awful and permanent and life threatening. Stressing about it all and simply scared of making wrong decision. I don't think I could cope with immuno. Severe side effects should they occur. It's all a gamble I guess and I feel I will never be free of cancer. Chemo side effects I can handle just about.

womb,Question,Maz25,Still awaiting biopsy,"
Hi ,it's quite a few weeks now since my last post but unfortunately I'm no further forward. I was told on the 11th December I have an 8mm womb lining. I am still waiting for my biopsy to be done. I've just this week had date through of 31st January under GA. That is about 7 weeks wait and a 5 week wait since seeing gynae/oncology consultant. I can't  believe this is taking this long. It us also over 3 months since my symptoms began. When I last posted I told you that my mental health is taking an absolute battering (totally unlike me) well I'd say it's a thousand times worse now. I have noticed that most of you ladies seem to be diagnosed really quickly from symptoms and have hysterectomy etc really quickly.  I feel like I'm forgotten.  The NHS have dropped this suspected cancer on me and then left me to get on with it for months. This week I've been to a private consultant and going back next week after he's had chance to view all my records etc properly but I've got a feeling he won't be able to do my biopsy any quicker. He seemed very much for me sticking with the NHS.  I can't get a break even going private. I'm not financially well off by any means but would have to find the money somehow for a chance to get through this.  I can't even get a diagnosis quickly never mind treatment....don't know what to do anymore!!!

womb,Question,Beezy_bee,Multi-vitamins Supplements,"
Hello everyone,
I am just about to go into my 2nd chemo tomorrow.  I had mostly skin related itchiness and my skin turned purple around the joints.  Luckily they recovered after a week.  I checked with the consultant if I could take supplements and she said to take multi-vitamins but not high dosage of Vitamin C and E as these will mess up the chemo drugs (Paclitaxel & Carboplatin).   As I had hysterectomy before my diagnosis, I have also been thrown into menopause and so my skin irritation could have been a side effect and also possibly due to menopause caused by surgery.  I wish to take natural supplements and wondered if anyone could share supplements that worked so I have somewhere to start. I have been researching on omega 3, propolis so far.
Thank you.

womb,Question,Claireywaireybaby,Post chemo skinny poos!,"
Hi folks
I'm just over 3 weeks out of my first chemo session and send to tolerate it well enough. Being treated for womb cancer grade 2 stage 3. Had my hysterectomy on Sept 30th.
I'm due a session every 3 weeks but Christmas made it 4 weeks.  
Of course I felt grotty for 5 days solid then started to improve. 
A few days ago (so 3 weeks after chemo) I noticed my pooping going awry. Felt like constipation but poop wasn't particularly solid. Had a bit of a temperature on boxing day, felt wiped out and been taking senna before bed to help. This coincided with hair falling out more seriously. 
Been pooping a few times a day, not feeling like I'm emptying and my poo is pretty skinny. 
I've worked myself into a lather about it. It sounds like bowel inflammation and I'm worried it'll delay chemo,  get worse,  turn into chrohns or colitis and be permenant... 
Does anyone have any experience or advice? 
Thanks ladies,

Bit personal this - I am on day 3 of 28 days of pelvic radiotherapy. This morning I have already been to the loo three times. I thought I'd have a week or two before side effects started. Johnny Cash's ""Ring of Fire"" springs to mind ;)
I am sure it is the radiotherapy, this is not a bug.
I have not been given any dietary advice by the hospital but have switched to white bread today and will avoid high fibre. I will still eat fruit and veg and drink plenty of water.

I received a letter yesterday from the consultant summarising my diagnosis as Grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma, MMR Proficient P53 wildtype but she never mentioned the MMR Proficient P53 wildtype which is scaring me as wildtype suggests its wild and spreading and does not sound good. I tried yesterday and today to get hold of one of the cancer nurses to call me back but no-one has and my GP receptionist was less than helpful telling me I am under the hospital for this and not the GP!!. I was only told it was a grade 2 at my appointment and they wouldn't know more until after my operation. Has anyone else had this diagnosis or can explain it if it is good or bad?  I will keep trying the cancer nurses and I understand they are busy but I don't like it when they say one thing and put the full detail in a letter with no explanation. I find I cope better knowing exactly where I stand so I can just deal with it..
 Thanks

womb,Question,Sots,Strange taste,"
I haven't had any form of treatment yet, and was only diagnosed last week. I still do not have an official stage, but results from my CT scan showed no spread.
I haven't had many major symptoms leading up to the diagnosis just very heavy and sometimes painful periods (I'm 43 so haven't gone through the menopause yet).
Since my diagnosis I have been getting a strange taste in my mouth. Its almost every day. I don't know if it's a symptom caused by the CT and MRI I has last week from the contrast or maybe even a symptoms of anxiety.
Obviously I am now over thinking every twinge ache and pain and just wondered if anyone else experienced a strange taste after diagnosis?

womb,Question,JamesYSK,What happens after Radiotherapy?,"
Hi Everyone,
Hope you are all enjoying the holiday season as much as possible!
My wife was diagnosed with Stage 4b endometrial carcinosarcoma back in May.  Surgery was unsuccessful at first.  She has gone through 6 sessions of chemo (which brought the ca-125 number down from approx 500 to 20).
After chemo she underwent a radical hysterectomy which was successful.  Scans have revealed no visible cancer, but, CA-125 is back up (after 3 months post chemo) to 55 or so.  She has now been scheduled for Radiotherapy (5 weeks.. M-F).
My question is:
I believe the Radiotherapy will have a positive effect.  IF/WHEN the number starts to rise again what treatment is next? 
In other words, after radiotherapy,  are we now out of options?  (Note that Immunotherapy has been ruled out by the Oncologist)

Many thanks and take care

I have to take blood thinners (Apixaban) for Atrial Fibrillation. I have been bleeding for two weeks. My womb lining is 26mm thick and I have fibroids. I have had oestrogen feeding breast cancer so cancer in my womb is a definite possibility.  I am on a fast track to get the hysteroscopy but the bleeding is leaving me feeling tired and sick. Stopping the blood thinners would risk a stroke but losing blood is also a worry. It is as if I am suddenly shedding this thickened lining.

womb,Question,Bluebellina,Delayed surgery,"
I was diagnosed with uterine cancer at my local hospital in August. Had a hysteroscopy and was told what they thought was a mass of polyps, didn’t look benign. During the following mdt meeting, it was decided I needed to go to a bigger university hospital, an hour away from my home,  for a full hysterectomy. The change alarmed me because I was happy with the local hospital. Went for a meeting with the surgeon and a pre op assessment at the new hospital and the date 3rd January was confirmed for the op. I was told there was a possibility of an appointment on the 13th December as there might be a space that day. Unfortunately I was in the loo when the phone call came through and I phoned back, only to get an answering machine. No one replied to my message. Finally got through the next day to be told it had been given to someone else. Still have 3rd January booked though. Now I’ve found out there is a doctors strike starting on the 3rd until the 9th January! Will I ever get this cancer taken out? Does anyone know if appointments missed by strike action are rescheduled before the cancer spreads?

womb,Question,Lemonsqueezy,Endometrial thickening from Tamoxifen (for Breast Cancer),"
Apologies if this is the wrong forum, but I seem to be in between Breast and Endometrial! I'm having my third hysteroscopy this Friday for an endometrial thickening of 38mm. This is suspected as a result of the medication Tamoxifen which I have taken for 2 years following breast cancer.
I've been offered a Mirena coil insertion at the same time as the hysteroscopy (under GA) and am in two minds about it. I'm a little worried about the hormones in my system as my breast cancer was oestrogen and progesterone positive. The research is a little unclear as to whether this is an issue or not. I'm also worried about the extraction of the coil in 5 years (I know that's a bit much, but I'm such an anxious patient). 
I would be grateful for anyone's experiences of having a Mirena coil inserted for endometrial thickening and whether this reduced the thickening and helped with heavy bleeding. 
With many thanks,
Robyn.

I'm a little worried about the hormones in my system as my breast cancer was oestrogen and progesterone positive. The research is a little unclear as to whether this is an issue or not. I'm also worried about the extraction of the coil in 5 years (I know that's a bit much, but I'm such an anxious patient). 
I would be grateful for anyone's experiences of having a Mirena coil inserted for endometrial thickening and whether this reduced the thickening and helped with heavy bleeding. 
With many thanks,
Robyn.

womb,Question,Matmar,Surgical Menopause,"
Hello,
Only my second post as was diagnosed with grade 2 endometrial cancel last week. Now waiting for the MRI and CT scan before total hysterectomy. I don’t think I’ll be able to have HRT after op due to type of cancer and I’m only 49 years old.
I’m so worried about how the surgical menopause will affect me - I’m reading on changes to my diet I can make and also types of medications that are available - but would love you sharing your experiences of this and any tips to navigate this. I know everyone will experience this differently but any advice/shared experience would be much appreciated.

womb,Question,CJM93,Stories of longer term radiotherapy side effects?,"
Hi all
I was recently diagnosed with stage 3a, grade 1 womb cancer and had a full hysterectomy at the end of September. I am only 30, but have lynch syndrome.
I am due to have chemotherapy and radiotherapy but haven't had the initial appointments yet for further information, though chemotherapy will be first.
I was just wondering if anyone here could share their stories and longer term effects of radiotherapy if they completed their pelvic radiotherapy treatment a while ago? My surgeon mentioned long term effects but didn't go into detail, and it's something that's concerning me. I understand everyone is different, but all google is telling me is negative and it'd be great to hear some positive stories, if any! 
Any information would be really helpful, thank you in advance for reading and taking the time to reply x

womb,Question,Aud40,Chemio treatment,"
Hello Ladies
I was diagnosed with womb cancer in July. I had total hysterectomy in October. I got the all clear after the hysterectomy. However they suspect lynch syndrome so they change the grading of the cancer to stage 1 grade 3. In addition to the few session of inside radiotherapy, the doctors recommends 6 session of chemotherapy. The chemotherapy is optional as it is new for people with lynch syndrome. Its entirely up to me whether we go ahead with chemo. I don’t know what to do.  
Has anyone been in this situation before (cancer cell had not spread but chemo still recommended because of gene mutation)? 
Did anyone go through chemotherapy ? How was it for you? Did you get many side effects ? Where you delayed because of blood test?

The urine test results have been put on my NHS app and have been passed to the Duty Dr to review and ring me, but I have been told to ""give it a couple of days"", the urine shows positive for blood and leukocytes and a fairly low pH.  I used the online chat and the nurse was very evasive of my question as to whether the leukocytes and blood could be due to the cancer cells being in my blood stream (the reason the lymph nodes are being tested). She sent me a couple of links around urine results but ended the chat saying she could not answer further and I should ring the GP again. I am now worrying as I have read that ph of 7 and over can lead to bacterial UTIs but is unlikely in lower ph.

womb,Question,Newboots,Pelvic fracture after radiotherapy,"
Hello anyone else had experience of pelvic fracture. ?
After chemo and radiotherapy for endometrial cancer I was on the mend and looking forward to getting on with life. I had my 
last radiotherapy in April . After a few weeks I started at the gym wanting to build up some leg strength.After 4 weeks things were going well so I upped the weight on the adductor machine . Bad decision within a few days I was in pain across my buttocks. The physio at the gym thought it was gluteas tendinitis.  5 weeks later it had got better. I was doing swimming for some exercise. Then I played frisbee with my grandchildren and it happened again. Recovered from that and went to see my sister in France. On my own so had to lug a suitcase round Paris stations, When I returned I was in mega pain and after a week couldn’t put my foot down.My MacMillan nurse was brilliant and arranged for a CT scan to be brought forward. Results were that I had fractured my pelvis in 2 places almost certainly due to the radiotherapy weakening my bones.
I’m still in a state of shock. I’m due to have physio therapy this week and hopefully they’ll give me some answers as to how to manage the healing process and how to stop it happening again.
I’m due to see the Trauma team in 4 weeks and to have a bone density scan.Would be grateful to hear from anyone else who has experienced this. I’m also plagued with urge incontinence which seems to have got worse recently.

3 weeks ago I had a radical hysterectomy with a tumour removal. The tumour was stuck to my bowel and appendix. The bowel was cut and resectioned.
Today I went for the results, unfortunately the pathology has not given answers and they haven’t seen anything like it before. It’s definitely a soft tissue tumour. This is in a leading Leeds hospital - I’m shocked they’ve not seen anything like it before. 
They’ve sent it to a professor in Belfast so I now have another month to wait and I’m feeling so low. i’m still in pain, bowels are not working properly and now this.

womb,Question,KT89,Anyone know anything about POLE testing?,"
Hi everyone,
I have been told that pelvic radiotherapy is very likely after I have healed from TH BSO. There is a POLE test being done on my tissues (takes 4 weeks to get resultback). Apparently, depending on the result, there is an outside chance I may NOT need pelvic radiotherapy.
I have looked up POLE testing and it is mainly research papers and way over my head.
Does anyone know anything or have heard of this test?

womb,Question,B74,Question about hysterectomy,"
I was told that I had grade 2 cancer cells in my womb and the polyp they removed had pre-cancerous cells, so they did a CT on Friday and called me in today after MDT meeting. 
I was originally told I would have a hysterectomy via laparoscopy and this would be at my local hospital if the scan did not suggest that the cancer had spread outside of the womb and at the city hospital 25 miles away if there were signs of inflammation in my lymph nodes. Today I was told the CT was clear and showed several solid areas of cancer in the womb, but nothing beyond, so I was relieved. They then went on to say that they have done further tests on the cells removed and now think the cells are grade 3 and so I have to go to the city hospital in order for them to take biopsies of the lymph nodes to see if the microscopic cells have got into the blood. They then added that this might mean open surgery rather than keyhole, but they may not be able to decide until I am on the operating table. 

Does anyone know why I might not be able to have it  laparoscopically now the tumour is deemed grade 3?

Thanks to anyone who has got to the end of my long post.

Hello. Am just reaching out to see if there's anyone out there, who has made the same decision as me regarding chemotherapy. From my profile you will see my story. I finished 25 radiotherapy on 9th August and had my first chemo treatment on 14th September. I have had a very extreme reaction to the Paclitaxel. Severe neuropathic pain and now no sensation in the tips of my fingers and soles of my feet. Spoke to a CNS on Wednesday because I was so distressed. Not sleeping as pain worse at night and she said that by the weekend, my symptoms should have eased and I should start to get the feeling back. This hasn't been the case and although the pain is not as acute at night and I am sleeping a bit better, I fear that the drug has already done its damage to my nerves. Therefore in consultation with my family, I have decided to throw in the towel. Even though they said they could reduce the dose I am very frightened of what further damage it might do. I was VERY borderline for post operatve treatment anyway, because the surgery was very successful. Has anyone been in the same situation and decided to give up? I don't think, that, with the support of my family, I am.going to change my mind, but very interested to know, as at the moment I can't quite shake the feeling that I am letting everyone down!!

Hi
Having Chemo at present for Stage 3c, grade 2 endometriod cancer and was originally asked by Oncologist if happy to have genetic testing. Now know that it will be for Lynch Syndrome and P53 mutation (late Father's two sisters having Ovarian and Breast cancer diagnosis respectively later in life). It's quite scary knowing you may find out something that other family members may not want to know. Feels a real responsibility but I personally really need to know with current situ I'm in. I don't have children but have siblings with children. One brother is ok with it but the other at present is having major heart health issues and I don't want him to be worried even more atm. My neice, his daughter is an health professional and she said she'd want to know herself but not sure her Dad would which I certainly can understand atm. He's waiting for urgent heart surgery so could happen even before I have the test which I've not had yet. Was asked about it mid July and agreed to it but not heard any more since about it.
Just would like any feedback on experiences of when speaking to family members about it and how long the tests and results are taking at mo if anyone has had it done recently.

I don't have children but have siblings with children. One brother is ok with it but the other at present is having major heart health issues and I don't want him to be worried even more atm. My neice, his daughter is an health professional and she said she'd want to know herself but not sure her Dad would which I certainly can understand atm. He's waiting for urgent heart surgery so could happen even before I have the test which I've not had yet. Was asked about it mid July and agreed to it but not heard any more since about it.
Just would like any feedback on experiences of when speaking to family members about it and how long the tests and results are taking at mo if anyone has had it done recently.
Many thanks x

womb,Question,Unstablemate,Bleeding after mirena,"
Hi everyone,
I'm new to the forum, apologies if this has been raised before, I started to look back but got a bit anxious seeing some of the topics!
I'm 54 and was diagnosed with stage 1 endometrial cancer in July after a year of light bleeding. I'm obese so have to lose at least 4 stone before I can have a hysterectomy. This is going fairly well with diet and swimming.
I had a lot of bleeding after my hysteroscopy and was given Tranexamic Acid after a week. I requested some after I had the Mirena fitted and was told I wouldn't need it. I was ok for a few days then I had a massive flood. I went back to the gynae acute treatment unit, wasn't examined and was told it should clear up in a few days, spotting is to be expected but come back if heavy bleeding. I would describe it as between the two. I called the oncology nurse for reassurance and was eventually prescribed another course of Tranexamic Acid. 
2 weeks post Mirena insertion, after the Tranexamic Acid course, there was no improvement so back I went to the GATU with a used sanitary towel in my handbag. I was examined, the Mirena is in the right place, and was given more TA plus Norethisterone tablets (progesterone). After a few days it cleared up completely - for just long enough to go for a day out wearing light coloured trousers. Thank goodness I had a coat with me. I called the onc nurse who said everyone's different, some women bleed, some don't.
If I'd been told at the start the bleeding may continue I would have been able to accept it. But after being told I wouldn't need the TA, then being told spotting was normal (this is not spotting), then having a bit of a struggle to get the second dose of TA, I have a nagging voice telling me that this isn't normal, something is not right down there. For some context I was originally told there was nothing of concern following a transvaginal scan in January, my GP noticed the thickened endometrium in a discussion about HRT in May so I have experience of something not being picked up. 
After that ramble, my question is what are everyone else's experiences of the Mirena insertion? Is it common to still be bleeding after a month, or should I insist of further investigation?
Thanks for reading. Best wishes to you all xx

Saw my Consultant this week, Scar healing well and the only problem I have is my right groin/thigh.  GP wanted to test for Myeloma but Consultant said she does not think it is that.  I had lymph nodes removed from the right and she thinks the swelling is due to lymphoedema and has referred me to the appropriate clinic.  It is really bothering me as it is painful and means I can't get out and about as much as I would like..  Have looked online and there are exercises I can do and I have been doing these.  Massage seems to suggest an upward movement so the fluid can find the nodes but having had them removed I don't know what to do.  Consultant said it would ease as I healed but it seems to be a slow process.  I really just want some advice about how to get rid of this fluid build up if anyone has been through similar.  Now just waiting for Oncology appointment as I need chemo next.

womb,Question,Avocado23,Swelling after Robotic Hysterectomy,"
Hi,

It will be 2 weeks on Wednesday since my surgery. 
I am OK pain-wise. I shed my compression socks last Friday evening as I just could not bear them any longer in the heat. 
In the last couple of days my lower abdomen has become swollen but mainly on the left side. I look really odd and misshapen in the mirror. I know there have been previous conversations about swelling in general, but has anyone experienced this? 
Thank you.

womb,Question,Esti,Mirena Coil treatment/Provera?,"
Hi there, hope everyone is doing OK!

I've recently joined and was wondering if I could ask a question about hormone treatment/fertility preservation treatment for early stage womb cancer. 

I was diagnosed back in February with Stage/Grade 1 a endometrial cancer after a hysteroscopy procedure to remove a polyp that was found a few months prior (as part of fertility treatment before starting IVF)

I was offered either a hysterectomy or the Mirena Coil as treatment - I opted for the Mirena as I would really like to be able to preserve my fertility if possible (I'm 38) 

Having read lots of posts on this forum (which have been really helpful!) it seems that others who have opted for this treatment are also being given Provera, or another oral progesterone medication alongside the Mirena? I was just wondering if this is something I should ask my CNS/oncologist about, to see if it's an option, as I'd like to give it my best shot!

Thank you

womb,Question,Rosalinda,Waiting for biopsy results after hysteroscopy,"
Hi – not sure if this is the right place to be posting as no diagnosis but on 2WW endometrial cancer pathway after slight post-menopausal spotting, internal examination by GP, next day abdominal and transvaginal scan – thickened endometrium 8.5mm. I wasn't able to book an appointment using Choose and Book and was told the hospital preferred to contact people direct. Result = anxious wait to get appointment, which I got morning after contacting PALs (had heard nothing for first 10 days) only for me to be re-contacted the following morning for an earlier (Saturday) appointment, which was then cancelled that afternoon on grounds of staff shortages. On the 15th day I was offered back the cancelled appointment! As it was the same day as the MDT meets can only assume they were prioritising appointments. I subsequently had a hysteroscopy which was unpleasant but bearable (I took painkillers beforehand). The hysteroscopy found and removed a polyp not reported on the scan (hiding behind a fibroid) and also took biopsies of my womb lining and a fibroid. I was told if results are normal then I will get a letter within 4-6 weeks but otherwise will get short letter (2-3 weeks) inviting me for face-to-face appointment to discuss results. Have managed to keep myself calm while waiting until I went for routine mammogram. Afterwards, I started shaking and had to go to cafe to try and compose myself. I think it was both the thought that I was the exact same age my mother had her stage 3 breast cancer diagnosed on a routine screening and I realised I hadn't been checking my breasts as I should. So when asked very simple question any concerns I stupidly had to own up that I wouldn't know as hadn't been checking. Mother already had hysterectomy in her forties! I have a lot of risks for endometrial cancer – PCOS, insulin resistance, early menarche, late menopause plus abdominal fat – BMI is normal but my waist measurement is not. The reason I have joined this group today is I realised there is a doctor's strike and am thinking this may be reason for system delays? Am interested to know if anyone else is waiting on hysteroscopy biopsy results and if they experience any delays. Plus any tips on coping with the wait? Also, the consultant mentioned I had atrophy – to be expected post-menopause. That sounded very odd, however, given I'd been referred for thickened endometrium. I know it's stupid to try and second guess results. I'm just trying to process everything. Also, even if my results come back normal I'm not sure the fear of cancer is going to go away now I know I'm high risk for both endometrial and breast cancer. I think it's the endometrial cancer I'm most scared of, however. I honestly don't think I could ever face a hysterectomy. So I've built things up to the point where I'm not sure I'll even want to open the letter from the hospital when it comes! Sorry for the rant. But I really needed to get this all out. There seems to be a wonderful bunch of very brave ladies on this forum. And in the context of that I'm telling myself how ridiculous all these fears are, especially at this pre-diagnostic stage. Has anyone else both been desperate for results and not even wanted to open a hospital letter? Am feeling nauseous at every postal delivery. Is this normal? Rose

Am interested to know if anyone else is waiting on hysteroscopy biopsy results and if they experience any delays. Plus any tips on coping with the wait? Also, the consultant mentioned I had atrophy – to be expected post-menopause. That sounded very odd, however, given I'd been referred for thickened endometrium. I know it's stupid to try and second guess results. I'm just trying to process everything. Also, even if my results come back normal I'm not sure the fear of cancer is going to go away now I know I'm high risk for both endometrial and breast cancer. I think it's the endometrial cancer I'm most scared of, however. I honestly don't think I could ever face a hysterectomy. So I've built things up to the point where I'm not sure I'll even want to open the letter from the hospital when it comes! Sorry for the rant. But I really needed to get this all out. There seems to be a wonderful bunch of very brave ladies on this forum. And in the context of that I'm telling myself how ridiculous all these fears are, especially at this pre-diagnostic stage. Has anyone else both been desperate for results and not even wanted to open a hospital letter? Am feeling nauseous at every postal delivery. Is this normal? Rose

womb,Question,robotxxx,Pathology report times,"
Hi all,
I'm 8 days post laproscopic hysterectomy and doing well aside from slight inflammation of my naval incision and a few aches and pains. I'm happily surprised at how low the level of discomfort has been, and while I consider myself an optimist, I was expecting way worse.
I'm still waiting for my pathology results. I was fine for the first week but now for some reason I'm starting to freak out. Maybe it's to do with the boredom of having to stay inactive, maybe it's to do with the sudden menopause, and I'm trying to keep busy where I can but I'm starting to obsess about the results. I've suffered form anxiety in the past so I'm trying to manage the feelings but I feel like I'm on the brink of freaking out or losing it any minute. 
I've called the nurse (she's not gotten back to me yet) and my Dr (they haven't heard anything). I have a follow up appointment booked in for the 29th (that was booked before i even had a surgery date) but I don't think I can wait that long, a full month after the surgery. I know I'm being unreasonable but I've feel on the ragged edge for the last 24hrs. I was really doing ok immediately post surgery but now not so much. 
How long did people have to wait to hear back after their hysterectomy?

womb,Question,Grandma03,Lymph node molecules,"
I had my appointment with the joint oncology team this afternoon, I was given the information that I had Stage 1a Grade 2 cancer which was completely removed with the hysterectomy and usually would not need further treatment.
 They explained that when the lymph nodes were tested they check for certain molecules, one of which is P53, this molecule had gone mutant and as such there was a likelihood that the cancer would return.  Treatment was explained 4 sessions of chemotherapy and then 3 of Brachytherapy but this is my choice - I could refuse treatment.
 The side effects were explained and the only definite side effect is that I will lose my hair after session 2.  The others are sickness, diarrhoea, muscle aches, tiredness and tingling in my fingers and feet. 
I have a new CNS who deals with the treatment side of things and she is going to call me on Monday to discuss what I have decided.  The treatment does scare me a bit but the cancer coming back is not what I want.
Does anyone have experience of having chemotherapy and how did you cope?
Was there anything that helped?

womb,Question,SJ Rainbow,Should I have Radiotherapy or not?,"
Hi Everyone 
After having a total hysterectomy in July my histology came back as stage 1a endometrial cancer with Focal LVSI and positive washings. 
The MDT meeting referred me to discuss radiotherapy with a clinical oncologist but when I got there, he advised me not to have it because of the possible long term side affects but said it’s my decision. It would be external radiotherapy. 4 weeks, 5 days a week 
Has anyone else been in this position? I’m not sure what to do. I’m 44 with 2 12 year old children.

I have been lurking on the discussions and trying to find some information from the other posts but have decided to be brave and add a post since all you ladies seem so supportive and knowledgeable.  I am 46 and have had the Mirena coil in now for over 16 years.  Since ever I had this had issues of lots of clots but GP didn't seem concerned.  I went onto HRT about one year ago, patches alongside my coil, and since going on this at least once every few weeks have a huge bleed.  I flagged this to the GP and again not too concerned but the Practise Nurse was doing a check up with me for something completely unrelated and when I mentioned it to her, she raised this with the GP again.  Long story short, went for ultrasound and they said they needed also to do the transvaginal scan on the 15th June.  When they finished they said it would take 2-3 weeks for results but Doctor phoned next day and said some concern over thickness especially given I have had coil so long, and that I was being referred on an urgent appointment and would be seen in two weeks.  No appointment came and I called last week to GP and they chased this up.  Apparently although its been put through as urgent, it is likely to still be some weeks before I can be seen.  Luckily, I have private healthcare through my job so I asked GP should I go down this route and they said yes.  Appointment now booked for 18th but I was asked to get my scan results to take with me which GP have given me.  Lining thickness is 30mm and now I'm panicking as of course, when they called on the 16th, I googled as had no idea why this would be a concern.  Realistically, I cannot do anything until I see the consultant and have the hysteroscopy but have a sick feeling in my stomach that its not good news and don't want to talk to anyone in the family about it as they will only worry and I don't want that.  Sorry for the long post but any advice would be welcome.

Hi
Had my full hysterectomy with removal of Omentum on 12th August.  I have not seen the surgeon who did the op but saw whichever Consultant was on a ward round.  I'm told I also had right lymph node sampling so I expect this will determine what comes next.  I had the vertical cut, 37 staples down my abdomen but I feel surprisingly mobile.  The only thing dragging me down is this right groin/leg problem which I have had since hysteroscopy (bruised or crushed nerve although a Physio I saw said maybe some inflammation around my hip).  I am wearing the socks but not for bed.  Husband making a great job of the daily injections.  How long did everyone need paracetamol for, I feel that maybe if it wasn't for the leg I could maybe stop now. Staples out on Wednesday which is the next hurdle.  I was in hospital a full 5 nights because I could not seem to shift any gas and so one of the Consultants offered me a pessary to help which I accepted.  Got me going and went home the next day.  Since being at home I have had occasional cramps then what I feel is wind but instead of breaking wind I have had to actually go to toilet.  I have been quite a lot and I am hoping this is something that will just settle down, I was actually worried it would be difficult to go. Anyone else had a similar experience?  Am I doing well only a week after surgery, I don't know.  Really just pottering a bit, walked into the garden, can manage stairs and getting in and out of bed very well. Just these niggles getting me a bit down sometimes.

Staples out on Wednesday which is the next hurdle.  I was in hospital a full 5 nights because I could not seem to shift any gas and so one of the Consultants offered me a pessary to help which I accepted.  Got me going and went home the next day.  Since being at home I have had occasional cramps then what I feel is wind but instead of breaking wind I have had to actually go to toilet.  I have been quite a lot and I am hoping this is something that will just settle down, I was actually worried it would be difficult to go. Anyone else had a similar experience?  Am I doing well only a week after surgery, I don't know.  Really just pottering a bit, walked into the garden, can manage stairs and getting in and out of bed very well. Just these niggles getting me a bit down sometimes.

womb,Question,robotxxx,Pain after Hysteroscopy,"
Hi everyone,
I had my hysteroscopy under GA six weeks ago.After the procedure I was in a lot of pain and was given meds in the recovery room which helped. Since then I haven't had my period, which I was still having regularly before, and I've had what feels like constant period pains. It's not the worst but it's getting wearing. It's stage 1 thanbksfully and I'm booked in for a hysterectomy at the end of August. I probably should have mentioned it at my consent appointment but I didn't. Just wondering if anyone else has experienced similar. Before the hysteroscopy I did have period pains but only for the first days around my period, not constant.
And any advice about preparing for surgery would be welcome too.

I’ve started a thread previously and got lots of good advice from Jane. I had a biopsy on my first appointment with consultant and , through a portal, I was told I had a 1A tumour in the endometrium . Not the best way to get info but there we go. On ringing gynae secretary she told me I should have had an appointment set out for end of May but for some reason this hadn’t happened. So I’ve waited and waited and my appointment with consultant is next week. In the same batch of post I have an ultrasound booked,for the week after, for lymph nodes in neck and also a pelvic transvaginal ultrasound on the same day. My question is that when I’ve looked online about next steps it says that an MRI or CT would be next. I had an over tummy ultrasound at the start of all this. Is this normal? Has anyone else had a transvaginal ultrasound after similar biopsy findings? I’m hoping that this is a good sign but then worrying is more time being wasted? All thoughts welcome

Hi I am 9 days post op hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo oophorectomy and lymphendectomy.
My progress with recovery has been going well. I am now walking 20mins per day on most days.  I had no discharge or bleed following op but last few days have been leaking a yellow clear watery discharge from vagina.  It's so runny that I've noticed ( sorry to be so graphic) if I pass a bowel.motion I also have a gush of this fluid go down in toilet. 
I rang hospital for advice who advised I go in there to be seen. They did all tests bloods/pressure/urine etc as well as tested the leaking fluid,  upon examination they said the fluid was from severed lymph vessels/ lymphatic drainage. Apparently it collects in abdomen and then is pushed or trickles through the vaginal canal while healing as it contains gaps.
Just wondered if this is common or rare and if anyone experienced same. 
I was advised to look out for signs of fever and abdominal pains and am now worried this may not stop after the vaginal cuff has healed, where will the fluid go......in my legs????

They did all tests bloods/pressure/urine etc as well as tested the leaking fluid,  upon examination they said the fluid was from severed lymph vessels/ lymphatic drainage. Apparently it collects in abdomen and then is pushed or trickles through the vaginal canal while healing as it contains gaps.
Just wondered if this is common or rare and if anyone experienced same. 
I was advised to look out for signs of fever and abdominal pains and am now worried this may not stop after the vaginal cuff has healed, where will the fluid go......in my legs????

womb,Question,P. Pitstop,Adjuvant treatment,"
I was diagnosed with endometrial cancer stage 1a, high grade 3  serous on 13th April. Had hysterectomy, BSO & lymphadectomy on the 9th May so am 4 weeks post op & recovery well. I was called in to see my surgeon last week after the 3 weeks wait for biopsy results & my surgeon said I do not need any further treatment as the cancer was contained in the uterus. Obviously I feel very fortunate but also anxious at the same time as I assumed I would be offered adjuvant given the fact that it was a high grade cancer but the surgeon said I don’t “qualify”. Has anyone else heard of this scenario? Thanking you in advance, P x

womb,Question,RedSquirrelsNuts,Anyone else with cramping as a symptom?,"
A week and a half ago I was referred for a hysteroscopy for post-menopausal bleeding/cramping. A t/v u/s found thickening of the womb lining in one area. I've been told it could be 4 weeks before the appointment and am going a bit crazy with the waiting.
I had breast cancer 2 years ago (clear now) and am on Exemestane so my womb lining should be thin. My oncologist obviously couldn't diagnose at this point, but she made the same serious/sympathetic faces that I got with the breast cancer pre-diagnosis, as if she knew but couldn't tell me. There was no suggestion that it could be anything else. Or nothing.
The symptoms I've read don't mention cramping. At best it's a constant background niggle with the odd twinge, and at worst it's like day 2 period cramps. Not as bad as day 1, but uncomfortable. It isn't really blood either, more a pinky-brown discharge on the liner.
Did anyone else get cramping?

womb,Question,JB2022,Looking for some immunotherapy guidance.,"
Good morning!
I am looking for some help/guidance please...
I have had 3 rounds of pembrolizumab and take lenvatinib daily. I started blood pressure tablets too. All 3 drug have diarrhea as a common side effect. The immunotherapy also have colitisas as a less common side effect.
I am 'suffering' with diarrhea, not daily and not more than once a day. I do not have ongoing stomach pain, only really afterwards. My consultant suggested what is happening does not follow the pattern of a side effect, more importantly colitis (meds would need to stop).
My question is has anybody else had this? If so, was it food related? Did it settle? If food related, did diet help?

Query how many biopsy results do they do?
I have thyroid problems under active do I need to have this checked again?
I also have heart problems which are OK according to my consultant do I need to inform him about the hysterectomy?
The one thing that did surprise me is that not all my health record is on my nhs record. I had my hysterectomy at a hospital in lancs but my notes fir my heart problems are with a different hospital seems to make more sense if all your notes are held on one record.

Also did your family eat alternative meals to you? I noticed someone said they had ice cream after the sessions, so what's the situation with dairy? Apologies for so many questions!!

Hi, 
I started bleeding discoloured discharge in March.
Went to GP who sent me for other tests.
I have had them and been told I have cancer, then given a pack from mc millian nurse who has been assigned to me.
Mri scan arranged next, then appointment to see consultant and his team.
When we got to the hospital only saw consultant and the mcmillan nurse who i could contact. Informed i would have to have a full hysterectomy by keyhole surgery. Also my lymph glands would be checked to ensure that cancer had not spread.
Given date in June for operation.i have not been told the stage of my cancer but thought they didn't know until the womb was checked after removal. but most seem to know what stage they are at. I also was given a date for my pre op assessment.
Having been on this forum has helped me and given me loads of advice and i was managing ok. Had a lovely holiday for a week came back thursday night.
Friday has been really tough. Got a message from the hospital to call them so that they can arrange my pre op and date for surgery which I found a bit confusing since I had already been given these.
When I rang back I was told my date was now 28th May and my pre op assessment 18th May. I told the member of staff I had already got dates. Felt very confused and panicky. I can't get any information why my dates are changed which has got me worrying about my cancer stage and because I wasn't telephoned tell 3.30 pm I could not get hold of anyone to help me I was told it would be Monday. 
I feel this system is wrong I have been given date for pre op and it is on the portal they set up for you at hospital. It would be better if the nurse they assigned to you could have helped me today. Feel a bit upset so I know I'm waffling but any advice would be helpful if anything similar has happened to you.

womb,Question,Bugalugs91,Advice/Guidance needed...egg retrieval after cancer diagnosis,"
Sorry this is a long one but ive included lots of information. Please bare with and help! Please! 
I was diagnosed on the 24th March with endometrial cancer. I had further scans and was told that it was Grade 2, Stage 1b and i needed to have a full hysterectomy! As i am only 31 with no children of my own, I was referred to a local fertility clinic who told me they cant do the egg retrieval/freezing because:
- my bmi is too high so the procedure to remove eggs is too risky (due to anaesthetic)
- injecting hormones in order to get the eggs is too risky and will make the cancer spread quickly and more aggressively 
Hearing the above broke our hearts (myself and my husband) but we started to process this information and carry on with the plan to have the full hysterectomy which is currently booked for the 15th May. The following day we then recieved another phone call from the same consultant at the fertility clinic who said he'd phoned round a few clinics and theres one 30miles away (approx 45min drive) that is willing to do the egg retrieval/freezing for us and that they would call me. They called me today as they have a cancellation tomorrow but where its a b/h today i cant discuss the time off with work so they've agreed to do it as a phone call with the consultant there to discuss my options. They have already told me that the egg retrieval can be done between now and the 19th May and that it will still involve having hormone injections! 

Obviously this is going to delay my surgery if we go ahead with this and if i have the injections its going to cause the cancer to spread more quickly and aggressively. Im now feeling at a loss and dont know what to do. On one hand i really want to try and do the egg retrieval if this clinic can do it as id love to have the option to have biological children through surrogacy one day but i know the risks of doing so. 
I think what i want to know is: 
- has anyone done this as part of their treatment for womb cancer
- did the cancer spread quickly or become more aggressive after having the hormone injections
- did the egg retrieval work

I know it will be different for everyone but i just need to know personal experiences of this and what others have done if they've been in the same situation. I'm feel soo lost and confused and just don't know what to do! 
My husband has said he'd love me to do it but not if its going to put my life at risk! He said he'll love my no matter what and support my decision so hes not forcing me to do it or anything but i dont want him to regret my decision later on either!

They have already told me that the egg retrieval can be done between now and the 19th May and that it will still involve having hormone injections! 

Obviously this is going to delay my surgery if we go ahead with this and if i have the injections its going to cause the cancer to spread more quickly and aggressively. Im now feeling at a loss and dont know what to do. On one hand i really want to try and do the egg retrieval if this clinic can do it as id love to have the option to have biological children through surrogacy one day but i know the risks of doing so. 
I think what i want to know is: 
- has anyone done this as part of their treatment for womb cancer
- did the cancer spread quickly or become more aggressive after having the hormone injections
- did the egg retrieval work

I know it will be different for everyone but i just need to know personal experiences of this and what others have done if they've been in the same situation. I'm feel soo lost and confused and just don't know what to do! 
My husband has said he'd love me to do it but not if its going to put my life at risk! He said he'll love my no matter what and support my decision so hes not forcing me to do it or anything but i dont want him to regret my decision later on either!

womb,Question,Bugalugs91,Advice/Guidance needed...egg retrieval after cancer diagnosis,"
Sorry this is a long one but ive included lots of information. Please bare with and help! Please! 
I was diagnosed on the 24th March with endometrial cancer. I had further scans and was told that it was Grade 2, Stage 1b and i needed to have a full hysterectomy! As i am only 31 with no children of my own, I was referred to a local fertility clinic who told me they cant do the egg retrieval/freezing because:
- my bmi is too high so the procedure to remove eggs is too risky (due to anaesthetic)
- injecting hormones in order to get the eggs is too risky and will make the cancer spread quickly and more aggressively 
Hearing the above broke our hearts (myself and my husband) but we started to process this information and carry on with the plan to have the full hysterectomy which is currently booked for the 15th May. The following day we then recieved another phone call from the same consultant at the fertility clinic who said he'd phoned round a few clinics and theres one 30miles away (approx 45min drive) that is willing to do the egg retrieval/freezing for us and that they would call me.

womb,Question,Duffers Mum,Bleeding after Hysteroscopy and Biopsy,"
I’ve had to start a new thread as I can’t seem to post on the original one I started.
I had a hysteroscopy and biopsy last Wednesday…I’m getting a bit worried now as there is still blood appearing (when I wipe after a wee), it’s not a massive amount but enough to cause me concern, last time the bleeding stopped after a couple of days?
I’m now laying awake at night with all sorts going through my mind…I also have the worry that I’m very overweight and about to be diagnosed with T2 diabetes, so if I need a hysterectomy they probably won’t be able to do it..
my husband keeps telling me to stop worrying as no results are back yet but that’s easy for him to say it’s not him going through it.
Anybody else had this going on almost a week after biopsy taken?

womb,Question,eeyore76,Hysteroscopy Spread Malignant Cells Outside Uterus?,"
I'm scheduled for D&C with hysteroscopy on March 31. I've been researching a little - and several reputable sources have reported that the hysteroscopy carries the risk of spreading cancerous/pre-cancerous cells into the peritoneum... with the potential to escalate a stage I diagnosis to a stage III. 
I had the tsv that showed 18.7 endometrial thickening (I'm periomenopause with non-stop bleeding for 6th week now), 4.7 cycst on left ovary, and some microcystic areas - not able to rule out adenomyosis.
My question is, can't the D&C give them what they need for a biopsy - must I have the hysteroscopy?  I have pre-op next Tuesday, and I'm going to ask that question... what risk would there be to opt out of the hysteroscopy... but I wanted to see if anyone here had personal insight.
I'm more worried about cancer spreading if applicable.  If there is something else that the hysteroscopy could show, but it carries less risk than potentially spreading cancer cells, I'm not interested in taking that risk.

womb,Question,Saz26,Not coping with waiting for grade,"
Hi everyone sorry for long post, I’m just looking for some help coping with waiting for the final grade of my cancer. I’ve made a great recovery from surgery but now I can’t stop crying and feeling scared. I was told on 24 Jan 2023 I had grade 3, aggressive endometrial cancer possibly clear cell or serous but needed further tests on the polyp. 28 Feb robotic hysterectomy, lymph node, omentum sampling etc. Last week, after chasing my CNS, I was told at 7:45pm on Friday night 24 March there was no spread anywhere still stage 1A. Good news. As they had no cancerous tissue to test, they asked for the polyp slides to be sent to them from my local hospital. Slides sent on 23 March and I was told I’d be called yesterday 31 March after the usual Friday MDT meeting. Called CNS at 2pm got voicemail left a message, called at 5pm voicemail left a message. Emailed at 7:30pm got out of office saying CNS on holiday until 11 April and same from surgeon secretary…burst into tears. I’ve had no call or meeting since surgery in Feb, everything I know so far has been due to me chasing. I feel like I don’t matter, no one medical seems to care what this waiting is doing to me mentally. Grade 3 is scary as I know from reading all your stories. As a minimum even with no spread, no lymph node involvement and no womb lining invasion, I’m assuming brachytherapy to prevent recurrence and chemo if it’s serous type. Until I know what type I just can’t move on and being ignored has tipped me into panic mode. I had breast cancer in April 2007. My daughter then had a breakdown in April 2011 Easter weekend aged 14 years, she still lives with me. So Easter and this time of year is always hard. Last week a friend of mine lost his wife (same age as me 61) to a recurrence of grade 3 breast cancer in the liver, she died a week after getting jaundice. Any suggestions on how to cope with this waiting or who I else I can call would be wonderful….I know the NHS is struggling but so are we….
Update - After throwing my toys out of the pram a gynae-oncology doctor called me last week and emailed me yesterday Thursday 6th April. A senior pathologist has now reviewed my polyp slides, still Grade 3 highly undifferentiated and atypical cells apparently! He's now asked to see my hysterectomey specimens. Next MDT meeting is Friday 14th April. I'm calmer now and had a long chat with another CNS yesterday too about my recovery since surgery as I've not had a post-op appointment yet. I then booked a short break in a caravan by the seaside with my daughter and our dog for Easter. I'm sure the change of scene will help i'm back to my normal positive self now. Thanks for all your support and encouragement last week when it all got a bit much x

Hi all, Monday of last week I had a laparoscopic hysterectomy. So far, so good. Yesterday I got a call from the Macmillan nurse at the hospital advising me that the results of testing my bits and pieces were in. Apparently the cancer wasn't as superficial as was first thought and I now have to undergo a few sessions of radiotherapy. The cancer is grade 1b hence the radiotherapy. Still early but a bit of a worry nonetheless. I just wanted to ask if anyone else here has had the same thing happen to them. If so, how was it? Did the radiotherapy do the trick? Once I've had the radiotherapy I'll have a follow up in six months. Which would clash a bit with my holiday to Australia in October. It will be internal radiotherapy.

Apparently the cancer wasn't as superficial as was first thought and I now have to undergo a few sessions of radiotherapy. The cancer is grade 1b hence the radiotherapy. Still early but a bit of a worry nonetheless. I just wanted to ask if anyone else here has had the same thing happen to them. If so, how was it? Did the radiotherapy do the trick? Once I've had the radiotherapy I'll have a follow up in six months. Which would clash a bit with my holiday to Australia in October. It will be internal radiotherapy. Your thoughts would be much appreciated. Thanks x

womb,Question,Sunnyjungle348,Post menopausal bleeding,"
Sorry if this is repeating other posts but just wanted a little advice.
I’m 46 and post menopausal. My periods stopped early which may be because I only have 1 ovary. I had the other removed approx 15 years ago as I had a benign dermoid tumour.
I’ve been on evorel conti for 2.5 years and so no periods. I hadn’t had a period for over a year before I started on the HRT.
During the first 6 months of HRT I had ongoing spotting/bleeding which was apparently normal. Towards the end of the 6 months I spoke to my doctor who sent me for a Vaginal scan. Nothing was found and the bleeding stopped so all good.
A couple of weeks ago I had what was like a light period for about 5 days. No real other symptoms, a little light cramping. I did an online triage thing at my doctor and after a week got a call. She said that she wanted to palpate my stomach so need a face to face appointment which reception would call me to arrange but it would probably be sometime in April. That was last week, still no call to arrange has come through. 
yesterday I had some more bleeding. A very small amount, just flecks of blood in the loo when I went for a wee, and some watery blood when I wiped. It seems to have stopped again now.
my question is: having googled shouldn’t they be looking at this a bit more urgently? I mean I’m sure it’s fine as I’m not on estrigen only hrt, I started my periods late and ended them early (so low risk), have 3 children (again low risk). I don’t want to be a pain but should I call back. Google seems to think I should have been referred to a consultant within 2 weeks.

womb,Question,Duffers Mum,Back Again,"
I was posting here around 3 years ago when I had some PMB, scans, biopsies, hysteroscopies, followed, polyps were found and removed under a general as they weren’t in the right place for them to be removed during hysteroscopy.  Results all came back negative and that was that, or so I thought.
last week, just before we were going away for a few days I had a reoccurrence of the PMB. I filled out an online referral at the GP’s and they have referred me under the 2WW.
I had a scan today and whilst she didn’t say much she did say womb lining was a bit thick, I asked for the number and she said around 8mm, if I recall correctly I think last time is was 7.6mm so not a huge difference.  However I’m sure I saw something on the scan, last time the scan only showed the thickness and not the polyps.
Not really sure what to think now, no doubt it will be another hysteroscopy and plenty of worry

I had a scan today and whilst she didn’t say much she did say womb lining was a bit thick, I asked for the number and she said around 8mm, if I recall correctly I think last time is was 7.6mm so not a huge difference.  However I’m sure I saw something on the scan, last time the scan only showed the thickness and not the polyps.
Not really sure what to think now, no doubt it will be another hysteroscopy and plenty of worry

womb,Question,Lijo,Recurrence with my Mum,"
Hi All,

I'm new here, in terms of posting although I often read through comments in the forum. My Mum was diagnosed with Endometrial Cancer in June 2022 Stage 2 Grade 3, treatment was 23 sessions of Pelvic radiation and 3 Brachytherapy sessions. She had her Hysterectomy in June 2022 which she recovered well from surgery and then started Radiotherapy in the November 2022. Fast forward to late January 2023 my Mum noticed a lump in her neck, no pain just happen to come across it, she was sent for a CT scan on Monday 06/02/23, and today we received the results that they have noticed some nodules on her lungs and believe that the lump in the neck is related I think possibly via the lymph nodes. We haven't been given too much information today but they said that my Mum will be due to start some Chemotherapy in the coming weeks. It appears that this is unusual and wasn't expected given my Mum's initial diagnosis of a Stage 2. I was wondering if anyone else is in a similar situation with lung nodule involvement? We have been floored with this and feel at a loss at the moment. Any input would be much appreciated.

womb,Question,Scorpiolady,Waiting for results,"
Hi all

Just at my witts end and feel absolutely terrified and alone, had 2 scans yesterday one being the hysteroscpy and a biopsy taken, not looking good as i'm 55 and been on and off menopause since 50, but last few weeks have been hell, blood test was a bit iffy with iron etc but nothing else, nurse who performed my hysteroscpy was really nice and explained the procedure, i managed it fine without anesthesia but as my lining is very thick which is a great concern they couldn't get camera high enough but managed a biopsy, she said its a big possibility that I will have the cancer due to how bad it looked but whether or not its spread further is a big question?, 
I just feel so out of my mind with worries, procedure, prognosis etc, I'm very overweight so a full hysterectomy while asleep is not advisable, can this be done with like a spinalblock/epidural? 
I'm trying to prepare myself for the worst case scenario , but I know it will not be good news, been so upset since yesterday, I cant talk to my daughters even though they came with me yesterday , would love to hear from anyone going through same or have done
Thanks

Hi, 
I was wondering if any of you had a hysteroscopy prior to diagnosis and how you found it? I'm pretty certain I'm going to have to have one as my transvaginal ultrasound showed a thickened endometrium and large ovarian cyst and I've been having heavy long periods(lasting up to 7 weeks at some points) for the last 6 months, but am really scared of having the hysteroscopy having read about how painful most people find it. To complicate matters I'll be having all this done in Portugal as that's where I'm now resident. I feel like I'm being a coward considering what you're all going through, but on the one hand am dreading the procedure and on the other just want to find out what's going on as I've been waiting 4 months since my urgent referral to Gynae.

womb,Question,Rosiexsam,lymphoedema,"
I have a grade 3 adenocarcinoma and am waiting to get a pelvic MRI prior to hysterectomy. My surgeon usually does lymph node clearance routinely for Grade 3 but the thought of getting permanent lymphoedema horrifies me. I also have MS and, although 20+ years after diagnosis I am still mobile without assistance. however, the thought of anything impairing my mobility is unacceptable to me. It seems that a certain amount of post-hysterectomy radiotherapy will be inevitable and I got the impression that more extensive radiotherapy could be an option instead of having all the lymph nodes removed. 
Can anybody share their experience please?

womb,Question,yr1982,Immunotherapy for endometrial carcinosarcoma?,"
Hello
My mum was diagnosed with uterine cancer three months ago.  She had a total hysterectomy in April and now has the results of the cancer they removed from her womb - she has a stage 3b endometrial carcinoma-sarcoma.  She has been told treatment with chemotherapy (two dugs in combination) is the most evidence based treatment for her type of cancer and is due to start it on 17th June.  My only concern is that she already suffers from peripheral neuropathy from colorectal cancer treatment she had 15 years ago and I've just read that the two chemotherapy drugs she will be given can also cause peripheral neuropathy!  Therefore, I'm wondering whether there are any other evidence based options for this type of endometrial cancer, such as immunotherapy, which seems to have fewer, if any, side effects?

womb,Question,wombwithaview,Bleeding post hysterectomy,"
Hi everybody 
Hope youbare enjoying the festive season.
I have a little question. I had a total hysterectomy in April of this year to treat early stage endometrial cancer. Did not require any follow up treatment. 
I have been doing absolutely fine but have developed very intermittent fresh bleeding. I don't think I have any other symptoms.
I am obviously anxious and have a follow up appointment next with gynae consultant.
Has anybody else experienced this? and if yes, what was the out come.
I am hoping it is related to stopping HRT at  same time of op.

Very best wishes

womb,Question,Lollie_01,Bleeding while taking Provera (progesterone),"
Hi, I’m hoping one of you lovely ladies can help to share your experience of taking Provera (for those that are taking it please). 
I’m taking 600mg per day plus the mirena coil. 
The last scan was showing no thickening of the womb lining but of course, I’ll only know for sure how much cancer is present following the biopsy. 
I have been getting spotting while I’ve been on this treatment. I don’t know if its a bad sign. My consultant always asks me if I’m getting spotting, as if its a bad thing but would be interesting to know if other women here on this treatment (I know not many) can tell me if they also experienced this. I just saw a fair amount of fresh blood, so I’m not sure whether to be worried.
Thanks for your help xx

womb,Question,GREEN3322,How does anyone cope with the 2 week wait?!,"
I know the advice to keep busy but it's on my mind the whole of my waking hours.  I can't even distract myself by going to work because I work supporting cancer patients and I'm not in the right frame of mind for that.
I'm getting really quite down now.  I don't want to burden my husband and haven't told the children (adult) because this time last year I had to tell them I have CLL so I can't tell them of another possible cancer. My best friend is a Macmillan nurse so it would be like a 'busman's holiday' to be turning to her for support.
After just over 2 weeks and many phone calls I have an initial ultrasound scan tomorrow but there will be no appointment made to see the consultant until he's seen the scan result - so another week's wait for that.  It's intolerable all this waiting.  How do others cope?

womb,Question,Rose Quartz,Hello xx,"
Hello everyone, I am new to this and not great at asking for advice so please bear with me.
So...a little background first...
I am 39 and studying to be a student nurse (albeit currently on a break thanks to the big ""C""). It all started last year when I was sexually assaulted walking to my car from uni. It was quite bad as when he had ""finished"" he then assaulted me again with a broken bottle. Because of trips to SARC and invasive tests, etc, they later found I had stage 2 uterine (womb) cancer. I was initially treated with 4 months of oral chemotherapy and hormone tablets. During this time it spread and became stage 3b. I recently had a total hysterectomy bso. Last week the nurse rang me to go for a CT scan and then rang on Thursday to say that they found cancer cells in my pelvic wall. So begins another month of high dose oral chemotherapy. I sort of switched off on the phone as I like to deal with things in chunks (and quite frankly would rather not know everything - slightly tricky considering my studies though! lol). The problem is, everyone is asking me what this new diagnosis means, survival rate, etc. I dont have any other information to offer you im afraid. I would ask Dr. Google, but I know better than that. So, I suppose my question is...does anyone know anything about anything lol?
Sorry for the long post.

womb,Question,Slaintemhor2018,"Biopsy, heterogeneous lesion and awaiting hysterocopy","
Hi, I posted about three weeks ago due to ongoing symptoms over the last year, I have bled everyday for a year (pre menopause) bright red blood and clots, waited 5 months for a scan which detected something which they couldn’t determine either polyp or other it said. 
last week back hip and pelvic pain escalated to the point where I couldn’t walk properly and I was haemorrhaging blood, I was admitted to hospital in the gynae ward. On the first day they attempted biopsy but too much blood so sent me for another scan as the consultant felt that the scanners could pin point it better than original scan. 
Scan came back and they said my uterus is expanded mid to lower section by a heterogenous lesion, may be a pendulacated prolapsed submocous fibroid or a polyp on a stalk but they need to rule out cancer. They managed to take a biopsy the next day, I was in distres and crying not at the biopsy but because I had to walk from my hospital bed to get it done and in extreme pain. Morphine wasn’t even cutting it I just need whatever this is out!

womb,Question,Slaintemhor2018,"Biopsy, heterogeneous lesion and awaiting hysterocopy","
Hi, I posted about three weeks ago due to ongoing symptoms over the last year, I have bled everyday for a year (pre menopause) bright red blood and clots, waited 5 months for a scan which detected something which they couldn’t determine either polyp or other it said. 
last week back hip and pelvic pain escalated to the point where I couldn’t walk properly and I was haemorrhaging blood, I was admitted to hospital in the gynae ward. On the first day they attempted biopsy but too much blood so sent me for another scan as the consultant felt that the scanners could pin point it better than original scan. 
Scan came back and they said my uterus is expanded mid to lower section by a heterogenous lesion, may be a pendulacated prolapsed submocous fibroid or a polyp on a stalk but they need to rule out cancer. They managed to take a biopsy the next day, I was in distres and crying not at the biopsy but because I had to walk from my hospital bed to get it done and in extreme pain. Morphine wasn’t even cutting it I just need whatever this is out!

womb,Question,Chewie,Travel and costs during treatment,"
Hi all first post here but I do log in and read a lot of threads about treatment. I was diagnosed in June of this year with mixed high grade serous adenocarcinoma/endometrial cancer. I've had surgery and am on 3 out of 4 chemotherapy sessions, my last one (hopefully) is next Thursday. I'm then due 25 external radiotherapy and 2 brachiotherapy. Oh and I'm only 30 years old. Struggling mentally big time, haven't moved from my bed since my last treatment.
I live in a really rural place, don't drive and the hospitals I've been to so far (4 different ones so far) are all around 1 hour 20 to 1 hour 30 mins one way. This would be 2 buses and a train plus walking between stations/stops if I had used this but I have been using a local charity for every appointment so far, so grateful for their volunteers or I wouldn't have been able to make my appointments as there's no way I'd manage to get to the hospital for 8.30am each infusion day and I'm beginning to worry about my radiotherapy as its going to be Monday to Friday for 5 weeks. They're under a lot of strain taking so many patients daily and I have had to change appointments in the past if they have no cars or drivers available so you can see where my worries are starting to creep in.

Is there anything in place for people like me who can't get to appointments? Even with public transport. I was thinking of something along the lines of travelling to my Monday radiotherapy and staying in accommodation somewhere until Friday and travelling home again I'm not sure if this is a thing? Who can set this up or look into options? The travelling is going to be tiring and the side effects may be enough that I'm worried of having accidents on the journey back. Any help or advice is appreciated thank you and sorry for the length of this post

womb,Question,Blooming,Back again.,"
Hi everyone. I’ve been here twice before, 4 and 5 years ago when I was perimenopausal. Both times it turned out I had polyps and luckily my biopsies were clear. However a month ago I had a post menopausal bleed and so I’m back again. The 2 week wait turned into a month as the clinics are so overstretched after covid. 
I had my ultrasound and then immediately after I had a biopsy. My lining was 9mm, They found a fibroid but no sign of polyps this time.  They only managed to get a tiny sample for the biopsy as I found it so uncomfortable. They are going to book me back in for a biopsy with camera (and hopefully some pain relief beforehand!).  So I’m am back to the horrible waiting game..

womb,Question,F4Fruitcake,Should I get a 2nd opinion?,"
Hi folks. You may have seen my previous post on 'Megestrol Madness' where after two and a half years of unsuccessfully trying to lose enough weight for surgery my Oncologist had decided to go ahead with it. I signed the consent form and later met with the anaesthetist for the next step. Now they've decided not to go ahead with the surgery and have said 'it would be safer' to lose at least another 30 kgs (6 st) over the next 6 months (now 26st). I've now been referred to a gynaecology dietician. I feel let down about the surgery but I understand their reasons, mainly the issue with breathing/weight on the lungs/blood pressure etc. I am now going slightly mad with all this and having depression aswell is not helping with my motivation and care of my health. My Oncologist says I 'have some time' and my cancer is 'slow growing' but I'm wondering if it would be useful or worth it to get a second opinion with another Oncologist and if so just how easy or difficult would it be to do this? I'm worried the bad cells will spread to my blood or elsewhere and I feel leaving it untreated for another 6 months could be even more risky than the surgery. Any thoughts or experiences about 2nd opinions? Thanks. Louise.

womb,Question,Suki Silver,External beam or brachytherapy?,"
I am very concerned about vaginal damage from radiotherapy, I have a very healthy sex drive and enjoy sex a lot, I am single so I don't have a loving long-term partner to help 'come to terms' with radiotherapy side effects.
Does anyone know whether brachtherapy or external beam causes more damage to the vagina? I think I will be given a choice between the two, or both (I am not having surgery), and honestly I want to know which will cause more/less vaginal damage.
I am looking solely at quality of life as my cancer only has a survival rate of 2-3 years. If they both cause equal damage then I think I will choose not to have radiotherapy.
I'd be very grateful for any actual information on this as the entire internet seems to consist entirely of clinical studies comparing the two methods with regard to survival rate, there seems to be very little concern clinically about damage and quality of life.

I'm currently waiting for my hysterectomy op, scheduled for 6 October, after a diagnosis of endometrial cancer.  MRI and CT scans were clear and I've been provisionally staged at 1a. My consultant oncologist has recommended testing for Lynch Syndrome as I have hardly any of the risk factors. On the one hand she is being very thorough. But naturally, I'm concerned that a positive result could mean an increased risk of other cancers in the future. All 'ifs' and 'buts' at the moment, just wondered if anyone has had a similar experience.

womb,Question,SH53,Serous and Endometroid Endometrial Cancer,"
I am currently awaiting a total hysterectomy operation on 6 October after being diagnosed with endometrial cancer in late July. I saw my surgeon on 11 August who advised that my MRI and CT scans were, thankfully, clear so she provisionally staged me as 1a. I've had problems accessing some of my online correspondence so have only just noticed in a letter that my diagnosis is ' mixed serous and endometroid endometrial cancer'. This serous cancer hasn't been mentioned at any of the consultations so naturally I looked it up and it appears it is fast growing and therefore a more serious form of the cancer. I was feeling reasonably hopeful but now, understandably,  I am feeling much more anxious. I'm also waiting for an appointment to test for Lynch Syndrome. I plan to ring the CNS on Monday but wondered if anyone else has had a similar experience and can offer any more information. Thanks.

womb,Question,Fridgelicker,Worried about the wait for hysterectomy,"
Hello Everyone, I’ve got 2 primary cancers that appeared simultaneously, quite unusual I’ve been told-and quite a lot to deal with. I have breast cancer, grade 3 ductal carcinoma with some necrosis within, oestrogen rec neg and HER2 rec neg. But even more serious is the High Grade Endrometrial stromal sarcoma. Both need to be removed asap, but I was told I would have a hysterectomy first, as that’s the priority.. but only if it hadn’t spread to my bones, then there would be no hysterectomy. I can’t have chemo inbetween the ops as it would affect healing.
The biopsy was sent to QE hospital Bham for the Sarcoma team to analyse as they aren’t sure which sarcoma it is, and need to know before they operate (and even then, with some sarcomas they dont remove because it will reoccur) I don’t think there has been a verdict from them yet. After the CT scan, and  a nerve-wracking week of misery, I saw the consultant -the breast lump and the sarcoma have not spread! Still contained! This is the first bit of good news I’ve had in weeks, though it made me cry!
Then I had a call for a pre op assessment for the BC, and I’m booked in for a mastectomy on Thurs. The BC consultant says, after discussion they have decided to do breast first as it has a quick recovery time, 2 weeks, during which the onco-gynae team can decide how to approach the operation.
I was concerned that time is going on, and the sarcoma will be growing. She said it might not look like anything is happening, but she assured me that it was, in fact she had phone calls regarding the hysterectomy from 3 people last week, and they can’t decide which is the best way to approach it, which is worrying because it sounds like they might not go ahead/ it’s too complicated to deal with.
I had 2 MRIs yesterday, one with dye, 50 mins in total. The radiologist said they wanted to see up to the thorax, and to see how the organs are positioning when I breathe, so that sounds like they are planning to do it. Has anyone else been through a similar experience? Thanks, Julia x

womb,Question,Suki Silver,Are my team lying to me?,"
I've been diagnosed with Clear cell endometrial cancer extending into the cervix, Grade 2, Stage 3a.
My consultant says it's not suitable for surgery because the edges of the tumour were very friable, but..shouldn't they be doing a complete hysterectomy first? Then the qualities of the edges of the tumour wouldn't even be a thing.
They told me - promised me, which seemed a tad unethical to say about ANY cancer - that they were looking at a complete cure with radiotherapy alone, no surgery, no chemo.
My cancer is so aggressive that, according to research, my chances of 5 year survival are less than 35%, and there are no recorded cases of 10 year survival. 
What on earth is my CNS and consultant doing?? Their proposed treatment plan makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. I can't even talk to my CNS about it because she's the one who explained the treatment plan (or lack of it!) to me and said she was perfectly happy that they were aiming for a complete cure with radiotherapy alone.
I am baffled. I can't find any examples of radiotherapy without surgery first or any curative approaches to my cancer at my stage. 
Something's just not right here.

womb,Question,Ejax,Bleeding after post op examination,"
Hi ladies - I had my hysterectomy, BSO and lymph glands removed on 5th July and apart from a week of heavy lymph fluid discharge had been progressing quite well.
At my first hospital check up on 18th August I was examined by what I think was a student doctor who was a little rough with the speculum and I found it extremely painful.  The following morning I noticed a small amount of bleeding which was a bit of a shock, however I spoke with my CNS who said it should settle.  Unfortunately it didn't and so a couple of weeks later they managed to fit me in to see my consultant to check it out - this was on 1st Sept and he felt that it was still due to the vaginal vault healing.  I requested a smaller speculum and the examination was less uncomfortable although I still bled afterwards.  I asked him if he thought I was overdoing things but he didn't feel this was the case.
The bleeding has continued although it is very small amounts....sometimes it is like pinhead size spots and I did wonder at one point whether it was coming from my urethra but I do seem to be passing urine okay without any pain. Other times it is a slight smear on the pant liner, along with what sometimes appears to be a bit of fluid.
I do have another appointment on 20th October so will just monitor the situation until then but I can't help feeling that my cancer has returned as surely if the examination had caused some irritation it would have healed by now? Can cancer come back within a few weeks of surgery?  Some days there is hardly anything then the next day its back again.
Unless the bleeding gets worse I feel it will be better to wait until my appointment as at least there will be a number of weeks without examinations etc and if it hasn't improved by then I'm hoping they will do some further tests.  
Just wondering if anyone else had experienced anything similar?

Anyone got any suggestions- not eating properly as feeling constantly sick and when I do eat it is going straight through me. Drinking as much as I can to keep hydrated. Being reviewed on Monday. They are talking about codeine phosphate. Have come so far and don't want to give up on these last couple of weeks of treatment but feel so awful with it.
The treatment is adjuvant. 
Has anyone tried anything else.

Thank you

womb,Question,Can,Chemo - extreme tiredness mid treatment,"
Hi all, hope you are having a good day.
I am in the second week post 3rd (of 6) cycle of Taxol/ Carboplatin and feeling particularly tired this time round. Nausea, leg and muscle pains have almost gone but still so exhausted. Have to have a sleep before and after lunch. 
Can you let me know what are your experiences with the chemo towards the middle of the treatment? Any advice regarding fighting the fatigue?

womb,Question,Pixie2uk,Hormone therapy with the coil,"
Hi I got diagnosed with endometrial cancer grade 2 back in January and because I'm obese they said I can't have a hysterectomy until I've lost weight so back in April I had a coil put in and got put on a weight loss injection called Saxenda I'm doing well with my weight loss. I had to go back to the hospital in August for a ct scan and to see the doctor to see if the coil has stopped the cancer spreading but when I got to the hospital I got told by the doctor that nobody booked my ct scan so there was nothing for her to look at, so she said she would rebook everything for me, I've got My new scan date for the end of September but the new date to see the doctor is not until November do you think this is a long time to wait or I'm I being silly. Since I've had the coil put in I've only had 2 lots of bloody urine and feel absolutely fine, the doctors also said I was fine to go on holiday for 2 weeks in September.

So I was told that if I have the operation that day I should be out of hospital in a couple of days and then I could go on the holiday later in the week and that will be fine, or I could ring the hospital the next day (as my appointment was at 4:30) and see if I could change it so I rang today and asked if I had the opp could I still go away to be told no you couldn’t go so I just cancelled it and told them to send me another date.

I hope i don’t sound disrespectful or weird but i feel so guilty saying i have cancer . I have been told off for saying Cancer Lite! I keep reminding myself to say Treatable Cancer, when i start telling folk that is. Or does anyone have a better suggestion. 
Also regarding the single questionable lymph node? How can that happen if 1a ? Also VERY concerned they would want to take lymphs to check, so nervous about potential swelling. I know its odd but I have a face even my mother struggled to love but my best feature is my pins ! So vain!

womb,Question,SH53,Awaiting scan results,"
I've noticed that quite a few people on the forum have received their scan results via a telephone call. I was diagnosed on 20 July a week after biopsies were taken and subsequently had an MRI on 24 July. I then had a call inviting me for a follow up appointment, so everything seemed to be moving very quickly. The follow up appointment was later cancelled as I was told that I also needed a CT scan which was carried out on 30 July. I now have an appointment with a consultant from the Gynaecological Oncology department on 11 August. I'm presuming my scan results - and potential treatment plan - will be discussed at this appointment. I'm probably overthinking things but I can't help wondering, and worrying a little, why some people receive their results quite quickly via a phone call and others, like me, have to wait for a formal appointment. I'm trying to keep positive but waiting for results is very stressful.

When I bend over , picking up clothes, using the dust pan and brush, I feel a fullness inside, sometimes its a sharp pinch, sometimes a pressure feeling, sorry to be so graphic but almost like a tampon is coming out, and at 3 years post menopausal it certainly isn’t that! I had this before the biopsy so not a new sensation. I also have a pelvic ache, a mix between period type pain and holding a wee too long, and that’s constant. 
The other thing on my mind is bloating, I feel so bloated most of the day, but it does sometimes go away, it isn’t constant. I am not eating well because food makes it worse and I don’t have much of an appetite anyway.

I'm having my operation in about 2 weeks' time and there's a couple of things I'm anxious about.  Firstly, I'm told I'll need injections for 4 weeks afterwards.  There's absolutely no way I can inject myself, I find that absolutely terrifying.  When I had my previous operation for breast cancer 3 years ago, I had the same problem.  I was supposed to inject myself for 2 weeks.  On the day of my discharge, the nurses eventually agreed to ask the community nursing team saying they didn't normally do it.  I was initially asked to contact the team myself! It seems I will be in the same position again, only this time we've got Covid making everything even harder.  From memory, I think someone in another forum treated at a different hospital said she didn't have to have the injections.  I realise you have to be really quite active not to need the injections.  Not sure I will be judging from the previous experience.  Seems quite worrying to not have them when they're supposed to be for 4 weeks.  Also, my brother died of a pulmonary embolism not so long ago (not following surgery). 

My other concern is if I have dressings - will I be expected to remove them myself?  I can't imagine being able to do this either.  I had to go to my previous doctor's for the nurse to remove a strip across my belly scar. 

I'm wondering what other people's experiences of these matters has been?

womb,Question,Anniie,Operation options,"
Been to see my consultant this week and we were discussing options for my Hysterectomy. 
They want to do complete removal, taking tubes, ovaries and lymph nodes sample as well. 

Complication is the fact that I have asthma, I don't react well to anaesthetic (I take hours to come round after) and my weight. 
Ive dropped a stone and 4 BMI points in the last month, which is good news and now puts me in the right area for Keyhole/Laprascopic, open or Robotic surgery. 

Robotic is probably off the table due to the only hospital locally doing it (rightly in my opinion) prioritising higher grade than I have (grade 1a) 

Which leaves laprascopic/keyhole which I am 1 BMI point to high for atm, but could probably drop onto range for in the next few weeks  the way I'm going with weight loss at the moment. 
Or....
Open surgery with an ""apronectomy"" which I'd never heard of. 
Apparently the cut would go almost hip to hip rather then pubic bone to rib cage, and remove some excess skin and fat that is in the way. 
Had anyone had open surgery done this way? Is it as scary as it sounds? How long was the operation? How long were you in hospital? What was it like for recovery etc? Pain levels? How long until you were active again? 
Sorry, lots of questions but I haven't ever heard of this so I wanted other perspectives. 

Thank you

womb,Question,Hupomone22,Vaginal Hysterectomy,"
After 24 weeks since initial red flag referral and after meeting 7 different consultants I have finally been given a date for surgery.

The last consultant I saw and according to my pre op nurse will be the surgeon on the day has said he will perform the hysterectomy vaginally only. I.e no external cutting at all. Has anyone had this style of hysterectomy performed for womb cancer? 
From my own research I can see that it is called the gold standard method for a hysterectomy in all benign conditions but there's not alot of info for this method in cancer patients. 
I was also told that if they cannot remove the womb via the vaginal canal (never had children) they'll abandon surgery and insert a coil to medically manage the cancer. 
This is not what I want and would rather they performed it laprasopiclly or even open surgery but it seems if I refuse this date and proposed treatment I'll be left waiting weeks and weeks again.

womb,Question,Ejax,Post Surgery Exercises,"
Hi all
I've just been having a read through all the information the hospital gave me in preparation for my surgery and there seems to be an awful lot of exercises to do.  
I know getting mobile asap is important but the breathing exercises and possible phlegm on chest worries me a bit.  Whenever I get a cold I always seem to have an everlasting cough that takes me ages to get rid of and the thought of having to cough to clear my chest just after my insides have been removed is just adding to my anxiety.
Did other ladies have to do this after their surgery?  And the phlegm on chest is that a common side effect from the surgery...I believe its something to do with getting the lungs working properly again?

Hi everyone, It's 3 weeks tomorrow since my Total Hysterectomy. My recovery is going as well it can I think, mobility is a lot better and I have a normal bra on today for the first time now my bloat is right down - just a tad swollen and bruised still. My mind is now weighed down by the wait. I know this is a 'how long is a piece of string' question but when I spoke to the Consultant after surgery he said I should know in 2 weeks and he would phone me. I've had zero communication from anyone at all since being discharged. My mind is racing. I know how repetitive this is for all our stories but how long did everyone else have to wait? I'm wondering whether to email consultant's secretary? I do not have a CNS as unstaged (pre-cancer biopsied from polyp only so far).

womb,Question,nightingale19,Hair loss after hysterectomy?,"
Since my operation (radical hysterectomy) around 2.5 years ago, I have developed female pattern baldness. The hair on the top of my head has got thinner and thinner and now I am nearly bald on top.  The general consensus seems to be it is caused by the loss of female hormones from  the operation although not everyone is affected to the same extent.. However I cannot take female hormone supplements - my consultant does not recommend female hormone supplements or even creams after a radical hysterectomy. Anyone here experienced this? Have you used Rogaine? Does it work?. Or a small hairpiece? Similar experiences and solutions appreciated

womb,Question,Ejax,Feeling a bit flat after appointment with consultant,"
Hi ladies
So after a very long wait I finally got my MRI results last week which has initially staged as a 1b (phase 1) 3cm tumour which is over 50% through wall so I was initially quite positive about the prognosis.  My local hospital refers anything over a 1b to another hospital which is about an hour away and I had my appointment with the consultant, pre op admission and pre op assessment a couple of days ago....although I was since told I need to go back for a Covid test 3 days prior to surgery and then isolate.
I found the appointment with the consultant quite daunting as he reeled off all the risks of surgery, including death and to be honest I came out wondering whether surgery was the right option...I know it is but I am now fearful I may not make it through surgery or will end up with a number of complications post surgery.  The MRI showed no issues with lymph nodes but consultant said he would remove as there is a 1 in 10 chance of their being disease in them.
I know they probably have to make patients aware of the risks and that the reality of things going wrong is quite low.....I was just wondering if any other ladies had received the same kind of response at their appointments - there was no reassurance from the consultant that these problem are rare and it felt more like he was telling me that the complications are inevitable.
The surgery is going to be robotic laparoscopy but I was advised that as I haven't had any children then they may need to make a larger incision to remove anything rather than removing via the vagina.  The nurse also said I have to give myself an enema the night before surgery which is up the bottom...if anyone has any advice / tips for doing this I would be extremely grateful, or any advice on the other things I've mentioned then would love to hear from you.
Hope everyone has a good weekend.

womb,Question,SkippyT,very heavy bleeding/clotting,"
Well, it's now over a year since my diagnosis.
I'd been bleeding on and off since March and once I was diagnosed (1a) in June, I started to look at treatments,
I was advised that a straightforward hysterectomy would be too dangerous as I would be at very high risk from the anaesthetic (heart/lung/kidney issues).  After much discussion, the mirena coil was fitted in September.  The bleeding never stopped, it became very heavy, with either very thin, fast flowing blood or huge blood clots, often without warning and only just enough time for me too get cleaned up before it all started again.  By February, the coil had been forced out with the clots.  It was replaced but only lasted until May when it came out again.  The next date to re-insert is the end of June.  The bleeding continues - often so heavily that I can't leave the house for days.  I'll have had no treatment for nearly 2 months.The cancer is still graded 1a.
Has anyone else experienced problems with the coil causing so much bleeding/ having no effect on the cancer/ causing issues with quality of life?  Did it eventually work or did you move on to a different treatment?  Any other advice?
Thanks, Suzanne

womb,Question,Ejax,Symptoms worse since biopsy,"
Hi all - Going on from my previous post just wondered what other symptoms, if any, you were experiencing since biopsy / diagnosis.
My first symptom was when I started to bleed a little with what appeared to be mild period pain, which is what prompted me to go to GP who referred me to the hospital.  A week later they are trying to do a hystereoscopy but find that my uterus is full of fluid / blood which they had to drain quite a lot of.  Prior to the appointment the bleeding and pain had gone away but appears that my cervix must have closed and the fluid wasn't going anywhere.  Anyway they do manage to do a biopsy and did say that there may be bleeding for up to 7 days, well mine lasted for about 2 weeks and I was still bleeding when they gave me the news that I had womb cancer.  The bleeding did shortly stop after this but I am still having what appears to be a watery light coloured discharge and pain in my side where the biopsy was taken, along with intermittent mild period pain.
My CNS said that it was a phase 1 cancer, however I can't get it out of my head that it must be spreading if I'm in pain.   I had my MRI 2 days ago and have my next hospital appointment in a weeks time.
I was just wondering whether anyone else had had these type of symptoms, there doesn't appear to be any offensive smell and I don't have a temperature....I just feel uncomfortable.  I even rang the emergency gyno line the hospital gave me but was just told to take paracetamol.
I'm trying really hard to stay calm and not think about the appt next week  but it is really hard to ignore the discomfort I have.
Does what I've described sound like a common symptom of womb cancer ?
Many thanks

womb,Question,Cakenport,Hysterectomy Day Case,"
Hi EveryoneI've just had a call from my Consultant re: my hysterectomy surgery on Friday. He seems very optimistic about it all and has let me know I'm first in bright and early (at least I know now I don't have to wait around!). He's also let me know that as I'll be going in so early I'm going to be coming home that night and treated as a day case (!!), as long as I have someone home with me. In his words, if I was staying in and having surgery later I'd get booted out at 8am anyway!
My thinking is the less time in hospital the better, of course. I'm less likely to get covid for one thing. And I'm sure they won't make me go home if there are any complications.I've never heard of hysterectomy as an outpatient, though and I'm a bit dizzy now! I'm sure I'm in for a bit of a bumpy night and my husband is going to going to get an earful off me :/ Has anyone else had this and can you think of anything I should have on hand at home on Friday night?!

womb,Question,JayB,Pre-op assessment tomorrow,"
Hi again.
Have the pre- op assessment clinic tomorrow afternoon, I've got a few things I want to ask, but thought you lovely folk might have a few suggestions for things it would be useful to ask. 
I haven't got a date yet, but expect it won't be far off, hopefully a couple of weeks at least - I've asked if it could be after a certain date as the friend who is coming over to look after me is due to be going on holiday around the time and I don't want her to have to cancel it.
I'm due a total hysterectomy, hopefully laparoscopic, but with possibility they will have to do open abdominal - which I really don't want for lots of reasons.

I 've seen some people offered an epidural- are there any problems with them - I get sciatica occasionally and back pain so worry about any nerve irritation.
Thanks in advance.

I am thankful to be able to say that I have had a keyhole hysterectomy and ""all the trimmings"" (sounds more festive"") and was only in hospital overnight.  I am home and feel pretty good but have been supplied with painkillers which is excellent.  Also have to inject myself in my tummy with blood thinners for 28 days.  I have been told to listen to my body but other than this have not been given any dos or don'ts.  Does anyone have any advice for how to proceed, how long my recovery might be etc etc please?
Many thanks and best of luck to all who are travelling on this strange and worrying journey - I feel so lucky to have been treated to quickly.

womb,Question,jane2511,"carboplatin, paclitaxol- hair loss and cooling caps- any advice","
Good Morning hope all are doing ok on their journeys.
Due to have an appt on Thursday- I think it is the chemo planning one.
Due to have carboplatin and paclitaxol.
Did anyone opt for cooling caps and is there evidence that they work. Would be interested in anyones experiences.
Hair loss is the most upsetting bit at the moment for me. 
I am interested in trying cool caps but don't want to feel that it is for no point and it will come out anyway. 
If you have used them- whats the actual procedure?
I will obviously ask at my appt but just trying to prepare the best I can

womb,Question,BlueSkies,Adjuvant brachytherapy or observation only?,"

Hi Everyone, 


I've been lurking and reading for a while but haven't posted yet. However, I'm now having to make a decision that I'm finding tough and I'd really value some help.


Long story short: Age 48 Diagnosed with Stage 1a, grade 3, endometrioid endometrial carcinoma. I'm just over 6 weeks post surgery.
I saw the oncologists (another hospital, another 2 Drs!) on Thursday and she said it was my choice as to whether I had brachytherapy or not.
The statistics seemed to change between the two doctors I saw and the consultant said I was borderline as to whether I was offered further treatment or not.
The consultant said that grade 3 was my only risk factor and because she knew I would be diligent about follow up appts etc, I got the impression she was fairly unconcerned and she certainly wasn't pushing for me to have the treatment.
So my question to all you lovely peeps is did anyone else go down the observation only (i.e. no brachytherapy) route and if so what were your reasons?

womb,Question,Mrsceedee,Oncologist planning meeting,"
Hope everyone’s having a good day 
So I’ve just returned from my oncologist planning appointment. He confirmed that as far as they could determine my cancer has all been removed however because it was Serous and also in the cervix as well as the womb adjuvant treatment would make sure any stray cells weren’t still lurking.  He’s recommended a 7 week plan of combined chemo radiation with Carbaplatin only  plus 2 or 3 sessions of brachytherapy.  This means I will have 5 weeks of external daily radiotherapy with one day a week having the carbaplatin chemo on top followed by the brachytherapy in the last 2 weeks.  I’m feeling better having a plan and would be interested if anyone else has had this combined treatment and wether side effects were harder due to to having it all together. Upside is I’m not going to be in treatment for months ahead and the light at the end of the tunnel is getting brighter.

Hello ladies 
I’d love some advice please. If you saw my older post, I was waiting to go to my nhs ultrasound appt today. I’m due to have a Hysteroscopy and laparoscopy for irregular bleeding. So at the appointment rosary the abdomen u/s was very quick and the sonographer raised no concerns. I emptied my bladder then came back in for a transvaginal u/s. This seemed to go on for ages! The sonographer sighed a few times and asked me how old I was, signed again. She then said ‘do you experience pain here?’ And lightly touched where I presume was my left ovary. This worried me immediately as yes that’s where I’ve been experiencing the most pain. There was more sighs and she finally said there is a cyst. I said ok. Then asked how big it was and she said I’ll remeasure it in a mo as I was getting changed. She then measured it but seemed super cagey and said we’ll have to keep an eye on it and will inform a report to my gp. I was told to take care of myself and sent on my way. Now I may be being over sensitive but she didn’t tell me the size and generally seemed concerned but didn’t say any details to me. Does this sound weird to you?  She also said there was a lot of gas. I’ve been bloated on an off for awhile but yesterday I woke with middle lower stomach pain that just wouldn’t go. By the end of the day I had indigestion/heartburn pains and overnight it woke me an I could only get light relief being hunched in a ball in bed. My lower back also really hurt. The back issue when our shopping the day before spasmed out of nowhere and I had to come home from being out. I had taken ibuprofen and paracetamol for the back pain so had presumed to at caused the bloating yesterday. Today I still have the pain and I’m super bloated. Deliberately didn’t take pain relief to see if that eased the bloating but nothing. My stomach is so sore right now I can’t wear even jogging bottoms and also at my bra line I can’t wear my bra either. there’s so much pressure in my stomach from bottom to heart level I feel like I could burst. i realise I’m rambling but it’s just a worry as it all seems to be at once. I don’t know what to do, am I supposed to just wait for drs report? If the sonographer says it’s a cyst is that it, it can’t be anything more sinister?any advice greatly received. Thanks x

Morning ladies 
I hope you are all doing well today. I had my consultation appt yesterday.  I went through my history with him and he agreed that my cycle length and period duration are all over the place and not right at all, considering I have the coil. He thinks at this stage the coil is the culprit. This is my second coil, the first was fine and no issues. The plan now is to have an ultrasound to have a look. I’m also going to have a Hysteroscopy under general. He’s going to take a biopsy and remove the coil. When I had my last coil removed it’s was incredibly painful, worse than labour and I’ve had 3 kids so I’m glad it’s under general. My option will be to either have novasure endometrial ablation  or have a third coil put it. I was all for the ablation until I was told I’d need alternative contraception, which I presume would be the pill. Now I’m home today I’m kicking myself that I didn’t ask for sterilisation at the same time. Does anyone know if this would be possible? If not and anyone could give their opinion on the coil or ablation option that would be great?  My wait for the u/s and Hysteroscopy are going to be around 2 weeks I’m told so I’m going to try and keep busy and not focus on the biopsy and potential worse outcomes as much as possible. I’m just glad at this point that I’ve seen the dr and there’s an initial plan in place. I’m glad this group is here so I can ask questions and not bang on about it to my partner. I feel like this takes up all my thinking space and it’s hard to think about anything else. X

At long last saw the oncologist yesterday for treatment plan.  Been advised to have 4 sessions carboplatin and possibly brachytherapy.  I queried why carboplatin only and was told they thought this was enough for me and that pacitaxel has the most side effects with the least benefit.  I am wondering if my age is a factor.  I am just 70.  I was also told I was borderline Stage 1A/AB and maybe micro cell in LSV! but not sure.  I am in a grey area apparently so they are erring on the side of caution.  I was also told if I had been 1A only I would have been advised to have EBRT only.  Has anyone else experience of this?  Just having carboplatin for 4 sessions.  Very worried about that but dont want to question oncologist judgement.  Oncologist did say each have their own recommendations but thought it would be enough for me.

womb,Question,Bramble65,Preparing for full hysterectomy,"
Hi lovely people,
We had a call from the hospital yesterday to confirm that Pauline’s cancer has not spread (from the results of her CT scan). What a relief!
Pauline will be called in for a full hysterectomy in about 3-4 weeks time. They hope it will be keyhole surgery. There are so many unknowns but for now, what can I do to support her recovery at home?
Any tips will be much appreciated

womb,Question,BlurryOne,Waiting for hysteroscopy,"
Hi, I'm new to all this...
Bit of background, went to GP September 2021 after having a few light bleeds from about June 2021 to the September. I'm 49, but on HRT as I went through an early menopause (it's been 10 years since my last period been on HRT about 8). She referred me for a scan, had that done within 2weeks and everything came back normal.
I've had three more bleeds since then and bloating, with period like aches. She referred me back and this time my womb lining was thicker than it should be and they found an 'area of concern'. I'm waiting  for a hysteroscopy and biopsy. It's been a week...how long before I get called in...I'm worrying myself silly.
Thanks

womb,Question,Shellie69,Treatment with immunotherapy,"
Has anyone else been offered or undergoing immunotherapy treatment?
I was started on Dostarlimab, a newly approved treatment for progressive endometrial cancer. My cancer is in some of my pelvic lymph nodes, which were not removed last year with my hysterectomy. 
Unfortunately, even after the op, and 5 weeks of radiotherapy and 3 of bracheytherapy my cancer is still progressive..
I managed two treatments of immunotherapy, then ended up in Hospital with Dostarlimab nephritis. Kidney failiure. It was scary. I had a buildup of toxins that couldn't drain, causing terrible confusion.
I have had stents fitted to drain my kidneys. These have to be replaced every 6 months...
I have been treated with high dose steroids, starting with 160mg Prednisolone for 5 days, reducing every 3 days. Finished today. Thankfully my kidney function is back to normal range, but it needs to stay that way...so am now being monitored with blood tests weekly, for now, then fortnightly if things continue well.
So now treatment has stopped and I have to wait for another ct scan, due in July. It doesn't look like I will be going back on it unless major developments show up, with the tumour. And then it will be along with further steroids.
One positive with this treatment is it is different to chemo in that it continues to work when in your system. So I am hoping that it is positive.
So far I am doing ok, some numbness around my groin and inner thigh, fatigue, and slight back pain but pain levels are managable and I have built myself up to fairly good daily routines. I just have to keep going. Keep positive.
I'd be interested in anyone else's experiences.

i hope you are all well and had a relaxing extended holiday xx
just wanted to ask a question please… my mums on a 2 year immunotherapy trial - Atezolizumab…. It’s for two years… stupid question but what happens after two years?  I assume it is stopped?   Will the doctors suggest a wait and see approach or switch mum over to another drug?

sorry for perhaps asking a silly question but I am a bit clueless as to what happens after two years.. mums scan is clear at the moment touchwood x   she was treated for a recurrence of endometrial cancer and had chemo this time round to treat the recurrence plus they gave mom the trial drug.   First time round mum had a hysterectomy and radiotherapy only but it came back…

womb,Question seeking advice,Shoes64,New diagnosis and terrified,"
Hello 
im new to this forum, recently diagnosed with Endometrial Cancer. It’s been a bit of a battle, my symptoms started just over 3 years ago with slight spotting 18 months after having a new Mirena coil.  Bleeding Progressively getting worse, back in December 19 I had my first biopsy and at that time my consultant told me my womb lining was fairly thin and she reckoned it wouldn’t be long till I was into menopause. So basically go home and get on with it. Just prior to first national lock down I contacted her office as I hadn’t had the results from biopsy was told everything was ok and to see gp if I still had concerns. 
So I got on with life or not as the case was, I was fit healthy worked full time, love my exercise. However it got to the point I was struggling to do any of those things. I reduced my hrs to part time, exercise was becoming too painful, the bleeding was extremely heavy and sporadic. I couldn’t leave the house without a bag of clothes, pads, wipes etc. so I still couldn’t get a face to face appointment with my gp so I got them to refer me back to Gynaecology. So December 20 I had another biopsy and my coil removed my same consultant as before, she also made reference to the lining of my womb being slightly thicker than she liked which left me confused as the prior meeting in December 19 it was fairly thin. Again I was told to go home and let nature take it course. 
Its now October 21 and I’ve had enough, this constant bleeding is having a huge impact on my life. I decide to change GP it’s still an over the phone conversation but she sounded empathetic and in a few short months she readdressed all my issues. We went right back to the beginning blood work, we tried the suggested medication from consultant report and nothing worked. In December 21 she contacted me to advise me I was extremely Aneamic and I needed Iron therapy. I was to keep her informed of any changes. 
February 22 I can’t take anymore I’m at breaking point, I called her to advise of noticiible changes, I had more bloods done and an urgent referral back to Gynaecology.  I was actually dreading this appointment however I saw a new consultant who seemed confused at first but after a chat and bringing him up to speed he wanted to START AGAIN…So another ultrasound and biopsy during which I had a massive bleed, he seemed concerned to which I replied “this is my normal” after I was cleaned up I met him in his office. He told me he was worried and that he was sending the sample off as urgent. I also asked if he could explain to me the difference in ultrasounds. Lining going from fairly thin to thicker than liked etc. his explanation was the second scan the slightly thicker one measured 17.4mm and the one he took was 24.6mm. I asked why the previous consultant hadn’t investigated further if my lining was fairly thin to 17.4mm of course he had no answer. unfortunately my results did in fact prove to be Cancer, when he called with results he told me I would need a Hysterectomy. I’ve had my CT and MRI. I’ve also had a call from the nurse specialist inviting me to meet with the MDT team. This appointment is at the end of next week. I’ve since been sent loads of leaflets and booklets which are helpful but I’ve no idea what to ask the team next week. All I know so far is I’m a G2 whatever that is…
sorry for long post, it’s kind of good to write it down, my head is a complete mess. I constantly argue with myself I worry about things then I shake myself and say you don’t know so why are you worrying.so if any of you lovely ladies on here can help with anything I’d be more than grateful

I have had problems with my bowels experiencing pain before and after passing a stool. I visited my GP as i was experiencing a cough snd feeling sore in the chest. My GP checked my obs , O2 levels and listened to my chest giving me the all clear. Three months on i was back asking him to check again as still have same symptoms and again he wasnt concerned but arranged a chest x-ray which i am getting on Monday 11th April. He also suggested a scope down my throat. I am very breathless on excertion and worry it may be something more sinister. 
I have an appt with oncology/ gynacology on the 31st May should i be contacting them sooner if i am concerned as 4 months is a long time to have a cough and breathlessness. I dont like bothering the doctor.

womb,Question,Sarah16,Question about reoccurrence,"
I have read that some women who were diagnosed with stage 1 uterine cancer have had reoccurrences.  I have only just started on my journey (due to start chemo next week) since being diagnosed with both uterine cancer (stage 1a, grade 1) and ovarian cancer (endometrioid epithelial - stage 1c2, grade 2) in November 2021 after I had my abdominal hysterectomy (October 2021) which included removal of both of my ovaries and my peritoneum.  
When the lovely brave women on this forum with stage 1 uterine cancer mention a reoccurrence and my apologies for my ignorance where will the reoccurrence be if they have already had a hysterectomy and had their ovaries removed.  Are the place where this could occur the vaginal vault, vagina and cervix or can a reoccurrence be somewhere else too?   
I know this is a personal question which is why I thought it better to ask it as a new thread rather than reply on somebody's post where they have mentioned a reoccurrence.  
I am remaining positive however I also wish to be realistic as well regarding what I could face in the future too.

Hello all, 
New member and first time posting on this forum. My wife had been taking Megace for about 10 years for endometrial stromal sarcoma and she was recently changed to Letrazole because scans showed that the cancer was growing again so her oncologist wanted to see if that would help. Well it ended up making all her symptoms a lot worse so she stopped taking it after 2 and a half weeks. So it’s been about a month now since she stopped taking it but she still has bad headaches and nausea every day and she didn’t have these symptoms before the meds. So I wanted to share this hoping that someone might have experienced something similar and could let me know what their experience was and what might help

Just had my telephone appointment with my surgeon following MRI and he confirmed as suspected that the cancer is low in my womb and top of cervix but there is also evidence that the cancer has caused  my uterus to stick to my large bowel this means a radical open surgery -  and worst case scenario if it can’t be “unstuck” he will have to remove it and I will have a stoma. I’m not sure what to think about it and he did ask if I still wanted to go ahead - of course I do the alternative isn’t where I want to be. As I had said I was happy to go in at short notice if a slot became available he’s got a cancellation for a week on Friday so op is being brought forward

womb,Question,PinkSparkle,Endometrial Hyperplasia after Breast Cancer treatment,"
Hi,
Recent results of my hysteroscopy in November were that I have endormetrial hyperplasia. I had a phone call from my consultant which I was not expecting (thought it would just be a letter). I have anxiety and a call out of the blue had me in a panic. I am sure I did not hear everything correctly and felt rushed to make a decision. I have now received a letter confirming what was discussed to my GP, so that helped make things clearer.
7 years ago I had breast cancer treatment which was a lumpectomy, radiotherapy and then tamoxifen for 5 years. For nearly 5 years before cancer treatment I had a mirena coil fitted for heavy periods. It was fantastic and I had no periods while it was in. Due to the diagnosis I was told it must come out. Then I was on tamoxifen and apart from 1 period I never had another until about 8 months after I finished the tamoxifen. For a while they were just as regular as they had always been, heavy too. Then the gap between was longer and I thought ok I'm having a late menopause. I mentioned in passing about this to the GP and he referred me to the gynaecologist. That upset me because it meant I was officially back on the cancer trail again - my anxiety means I always suspect the worst. Of course I realise my GP was great and thank goodness he did refer me and didn't just brush me off.
My consultant had conferred within an MDT meeting with my breast cancer team as to how to proceed with treatment for the hyperplasia. They have decided that on balance I should have a Mirena coil back in to get my womb lining thin again, despite the usual advice to avoid this treatment if you have had breast cancer. Also, I am very overweight (morbidly obese category), such that I have been offered bariatric weight loss surgery. I do not want to take this option due to the risks involved. I have also at the moment refused the Mirena coil as I can't get out of my head how I had to immediately have it removed when I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I just don't know why I can't put my faith in the MDT when after all these are experts that have discussed my individual case. When I was first diagnosed I even had one family member ask if the cancer was caused by my obesity. Not helpful at all, and I had only lost my Dad 6 months prior to this so was in a very bad place in any case. I am so conflicted and I feel that I wouldn't be in this position if I had looked after myself more. I feel everything is my fault and that I am gambling with my life.
Has anyone on here been in a similar position?

womb,Question,Shoelle,I've baffled the doctors somehow,"
Hi all,
I had my first surgery in May 2021. It was a total hysterechtomy with everything out. Biopsy found the tumor to be a grade 3 so I started chemo in July and like alot of people I was allergic to the paclitaxol (don't know how it is spelt) and so I had  abraxane and carboplatin instead which I could tolerate. Then my chemo was postponed whilst I had a second surgery in October to remove another tumor which was found near my bowel. Luckily the biopsy revealed that one to be non cancerous. The relief was immense as I'm sure you can all understand. So I resumed chemo for another 4 cycles and finished in January this year. I am currently awaiting brachytherapy BUT when I had a scan after finishing chemo, the report for the scan says that the tumor they removed in October is stable. Hmm.... So now the doctors are baffled because none of us understand how a tumor that was removed can still be stable.  There shouldn't be anything there. So I've had another Pet CT scan and am awaiting the results of that and my brachytherapy consultant is understandably also awaiting my scan result before booking me in for treatment. 
Has anyone else been through something similar? Because I'm really struggling to stay positive right now.

womb,Question,Nonentity,Ongoing bleeding,"
Hi, I finally had a Hysteroscopy after a failed attempt in clinic due to cervical stenosis. They attempted to do it in theatre under spinal, but couldn’t do the spinal,  so it was done under general anaesthetic. It was done as I had post menopausal bleeding and a scan showed my endometrium is 12mm - I’m post menopausal (22 years - now aged 60). I also had bilateral pulmonary emboli some months ago, which the doctors say can be a sign of an underlying cancer. 
The surgeon removed three polyps, which have been sent to the lab, I believe along with other endometrial tissue, and she fitted a Mirena coil. (I’m obese, so have very likely had unopposed estrogen for many years, due to my premature menopause). This was done two weeks ago and I’m still bleeding. Is this usual? I’m presuming it’s the progestin thinning the endometrium - does that sound right?
I also have a 6.5cm cyst on my ovary, which they think may just be a dermoid cyst so that’s being monitored by scan - I had a small one diagnosed in the same ovary years ago. I had to cancel the first follow up transvaginal scan as it was for the day after the surgery. Then I got Covid two days after the surgery (triple jabbed thankfully- it was awful as it was!), so also had to cancel the rescheduled scan, waiting for another date. Does anyone know if will be able to have a transvaginal scan while still bleeding?
Incidentally, the surgeon diagnosed me with Lichen Sclerosus, which may explain the pain when they go near me with instruments.
I was told the biopsy results are taking 4-6 weeks, the weeks are dragging by. 
Thanks for any input you can give.

womb,Question,Lindy67,Trials,"
I was first diagnosed July 17. Hysterectomy followed by chemo and radiotherapy.  Thought I had beat it but it came back in Feb 20. After another 12 rounds of chemo and top up of radiotherapy I am on a break. The treatment I am now having is palliative care. 
My question is have any of you ladies taken part in any trials.  My oncologist contacted 2 hospitals and Addenbrooks have just got back to me. My oncologist said to find out if it was a test or treatment trial.  From the info I received it is an early phase trial. 
I would be so grateful of any feedback that you can give me

Went for my three month check up 9 months after treatment ended and although internal looked fine doctor has ordered a scan as he felt something in my tummy area.

womb,Question,MrsBJH,Trials advice,"
Hi all
Haven't been around as much as usual, side effects of cumulative chemo have knocked me for 6 and resorted to going back to bed, unheard of for me. Last Chemo cycle planned for 25th March. In addition typing is nigh on impossible due to PN. When I sent information about it to other group members never for one moment would have it effect me and so badly. Doing a bra up is hopeless, pulling socks on is a trial and I've got beautifully bruised toes where I've stubbed them where I can't feel them! Heh-ho
Anyway I digress, happens a lot nowadays!
I'm seeing my Oncologist on Tuesday. I know he wants me to take break after these 6 cycles of chemo and we'll talk about the way forward. My tumours might have shrunk but they'll be back at some time. I'm going to ask him about trials, I've already sent an e-mail about Dostarlimab and I'll ask about what Lucki's Mum is having - Atezolizumab. Can I ask what others of you might be trialling so I can ask him about them. I always ask permission to record our conversation so if I find out any useful info I'll pass it on.
I think I'll be having a CT scan shortly after cycle 6 so it'd be lovely to report the little b***ers have taken a holiday from me for a break too.
Hugs to all, Barb xx

womb,Question,Sunrise4,Diagnosis,"
Hi everyone, I am new here and was diagnosed with grade 1a at the end of last year. My diagnosis was through having a total hysterectomy. I had lots of tests beforehand which were ultrasound scan, a biopsy, hysteroscopy with another biopsy which showed atypical hyperplasia and also had an mri scan. None of the tests found the 1cm solid tumor that was there. I just wondered if anyone else has had similar experiences? I am grateful that it was found but am finding it hard to understand how it was not seen, especially the mri. I have just had my first check up and had a biopsy taken of the vault, the doctor thinks it is granulation but am now worried about recurrence and trusting the tests used to find it. Both biopsies I had before didn't pick up the cancer. Thanks in advance

womb,Question,Sarah16,Resection of common iliac nodes / right nodal resection,"
I was wondering if anybody could help me please however I will ask my consultant when I next speak to to her to explain this to me and can update this thread in case anybody else also has this question following their surgery.  
As part of my debulking for ovarian cancer (stage 1c) and endometrial cancer (stage 1a) in October 2021 I underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo oophectomy, omentectomy and resection of common iliac nodes.  
In my first CT scan since my hysterectomy the report says 'previous right nodal resection noted with local surgical clips'.  On reading the report I am very pleased that the CT scan does not show signs of cancer however I would like to understand what 'right nodal resection' means.  
I had lymph nodes removed during my operation but thankfully they did not show signs of cancer.  Do I know have metal or plastic clips inside me and what are they clipping together?

womb,Question,Sarah16,Resection of common iliac nodes / right nodal resection,"
I was wondering if anybody could help me please however I will ask my consultant when I next speak to to her to explain this to me and can update this thread in case anybody else also has this question following their surgery.  
As part of my debulking for ovarian cancer (stage 1c) and endometrial cancer (stage 1a) in October 2021 I underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo oophectomy, omentectomy and resection of common iliac nodes.  
In my first CT scan since my hysterectomy the report says 'previous right nodal resection noted with local surgical clips'.  On reading the report I am very pleased that the CT scan does not show signs of cancer however I would like to understand what 'right nodal resection' means.  
I had lymph nodes removed during my operation but thankfully they did not show signs of cancer.  Do I know have metal or plastic clips inside me and what are they clipping together?  
Or what questions should I ask my consultant to better understand this part of the surgery that I had?

Hi Ladies, my hysterectomy is scheduled for 10th January so starting to feel nervous. What they are going to do to me (vaginal total hysterectomy with salpingo oophorectomy) keeps popping in to my head. I know its stupid but feel I will be so exposed and have someone messing with my lady parts. Keep trying to push it to the back and just keep saying I'm going to go to sleep and then wake up and it will be over. Any good experience stories out there would help a lot. Hate the idea that hubby can't come in with me or visit afterwards (staying in over night) because of stupid covid. I had diep breast recon surgery a couple of years ago 9 hour surgery and really needed to see him when I woke up. Also any tips for before and after plus what to take in with me that's essential.

Hi i'm new and confused. 
Been having lots of problems with periods to the point where I needed an ambulance as I couldnt stop bleeding. A&E sent me to gynecology where they said oh yes your here for a biopsy as they have suspicions! First I knew about anything, but went with the flow.
They took biopsy and history, told me they were checking for endometrial cancer,  and I was sent home and told to wait for results. Two days later I got call asking me to come in for scans the next day, external and internal, the lady looked slightly concerned and took lots of measurements, said I would most likely need an MRI but my consultant would tell me more.  
Already booked an appointment with a gp for something else so went along and asked what was going on, she knew very little other than my biopsy wasn't good enough and I would need another. She said not to worry they will sort it at the hospital.
Next appointment a week later with consultant who asked who had rereferred me and why?????  I told him all of the above and he said the others have worried you, you are too young, you will be fine! I asked about MRI he said not necessary as you are young, you will be fine!! (Im 47).
He said I had a lining of 20mm and so he would have a look and he could tell me I would be fine! He has booked me in for a hysteroscopy and further biopsy.
The fact he kept saying you are young you will be fine on repeat really stuck in my head. I could clearly see on my scan notes that the lady had put malignancy of endometrial hyperplasia and she looked genuinely concerned.
He talked about further treatment options should we need to go further, but you will not need them you will be fine!!!!!!! Arrrgghhhh
Now I feel like I don't trust him or anything he does.....am left waiting for hysteroscopy appointment with no idea of when this will be.... am I over reacting here......time is ticking past and I feel he has put the brakes on a process I felt was moving swiftly without even examining me.

womb,Question,Tess57,Just been diagnosed.,"
Hello everyone, my name is Tess. I am 64.
My journey started in Oct when I started postmenopausal bleeding/ spotting and still am today.
Was fast tracked to gynaecologist, had an ultrasound a hysteroscopy by GA as couldn't get into my womb.
Biopsy showed Thickening of the womb and bilateral cysts, one being 9cm. Then MRI scan showed that cancer was in my womb lining, but less than 50% so graded as 1a. 
Not long back from consultant. Hoping for some support if possible please. Really struggling at the moment
Not been given an op date yet as hospital really busy, but may have a pre op assessment next week to do ECG, blood tests etc to make sure that I am fit enough for the op.
Been told because I have ovarian cysts the op will be more radical and abdominal rather than robotic.  At this stage they don't know if they are cancerous as well or where the cancer started from I may need to have some lymph nodes removed in my pelvic area. The surgeon said at the moment grade 1 but if the cancer started in in ovaries and has spread to the womb then stage 3. They won't know exactly until they take everything out and have histology on it. If it is Stage 3 then chemo / Radiotherapy.
I know they have to tell you the maybe's or ifs, but my mind is working overtime now thinking it's worse than I thought. Has anyone else been in this situation please.
I've had no other symptoms apart from my bleeding. All my blood work came back ok. I am so scared and full of anxiety. Thinking I'm not going to be cured.
The waiting is agony. Thank you for reading this. xxx

womb,Question,Tess57,Just been diagnosed.,"
Hello everyone, my name is Tess. I am 64.
My journey started in Oct when I started postmenopausal bleeding/ spotting and still am today.
Was fast tracked to gynaecologist, had an ultrasound a hysteroscopy by GA as couldn't get into my womb.
Biopsy showed Thickening of the womb and bilateral cysts, one being 9cm. Then MRI scan showed that cancer was in my womb lining, but less than 50% so graded as 1a. 
Not long back from consultant. Hoping for some support if possible please. Really struggling at the moment
Not been given an op date yet as hospital really busy, but may have a pre op assessment next week to do ECG, blood tests etc to make sure that I am fit enough for the op.
Been told because I have ovarian cysts the op will be more radical and abdominal rather than robotic.  At this stage they don't know if they are cancerous as well or where the cancer started from I may need to have some lymph nodes removed in my pelvic area. The surgeon said at the moment grade 1 but if the cancer started in in ovaries and has spread to the womb then stage 3. They won't know exactly until they take everything out and have histology on it. If it is Stage 3 then chemo / Radiotherapy.
I know they have to tell you the maybe's or ifs, but my mind is working overtime now thinking it's worse than I thought. Has anyone else been in this situation please.
I've had no other symptoms apart from my bleeding. All my blood work came back ok. I am so scared and full of anxiety. Thinking I'm not going to be cured.
The waiting is agony. Thank you for reading this. xxx

How can she say that from a 5 minute examination. I get it if there was a growth or lump but how can she see the cels….does she have a microscope for eyes!! Doesn’t seem any urgency  in it . Oh and she’s off sick! They must understand the anxiety women go through during this. I can’t relax until that biopsy come back clear. Keeping me awake at night.

womb,Question,BlurryOne,Feeling a bit worried,"
Hi, I'm new first post...not sure if it's in the right place so apologies if not.
I'm just after some thoughts/advise if anyone as been in the same position.
In August I had a bleed, I've been on HRT for around ten years, and haven't had a period for about 2 years prior to that so it very out of the ordinary for me. I'm 49 BTW, went through an early menopause. I visited my GP straight away, she took bloods, did an internal and referred me to the hospital on a cancer pathway. I was seen very quickly, and luckily everything came back normal. The doctor I saw simply said he couldn't explain why I'd had the bleed, but that everything was OK. My smear came back normal too.
About a month later I noticed a bit of colour on the loo roll after I'd had a wee, it was a one off. But today I'm bleeding again, it's very light but enough to worry me.
As anyone else experienced this? Am I worrying over nothing?
I'm going to phone and try to get a GP appointment, but with things as they are I'm worried that I won't be seen for awhile.

womb,Question,Craft Queen,Hysterectomy recovery advice,"
Hi everyone, I had my hysterectomy 5 weeks this Tuesday.
I had a robotic hysterectomy and they took everything and I am extremely lucky as no further treatment is needed. I had a bleed two weeks into my recovery and have since had a lot of pressure. It feels like my Labia is twice the size but it’s not. It doesn’t hurt but is very uncomfortable all the time. If I walk about the pressure is worse. Pelvic floor exercises are also very painful to  and after I have done them I feel like I constantly need to wee. I have spoken to the nurse and she has told me to stop all pelvic exercises and thinks that it is inflammation and it will settle and to ring her back again in two weeks if I am still feeling the same. I was concerned about a prolapse. I know something isn’t right and I am worrying about it. Has anyone else suffered with similar symptoms ? Thank you for listening sending hugs Em xxx

womb,Question,MarmiteFan59,Let’s talk about hysterectomies!,"
I’m on the urgent list for a hysterectomy following an initial diagnosis of grade 1 stage 1a endometrial cancer. My pre-assessment appointment is next Wednesday (15th) and the op should be within a month after that. It should be laparoscopic, as long as the surgeon can get to everything he needs to remove. If so, I should only need to stay in one night. I know that I’m likely to be given a spinal for pain relief (not sure how I feel about that as I had a failed epidural when I had my second child).  I’m aware that after the op my uterus etc will be sent off to the lab and the staging will be reviewed. What I’m interested in please is other women’s experiences, good and bad, and any tips please on any questions to ask and things to pack. Also what to expect afterwards, good and bad. No sugar coating or avoiding mentioning difficulties please, I’m the sort of person who feels better the more I know about what’s involved. I had an emergency C section by GA for my first child so I’ve already experienced abdominal surgery but it was over 30 years ago and may benefit from reminders!

womb,Question,,New and confused,"
Hi All,
I am feeling quite overwhelmed at the moment so am hoping to learn from others experiences. On Sunday, after 2 years of no period I woke up with a tummy ache  and found blood when I went to the loo. So jokingly I told my friend that menopause sucks as my period came back. She suggested I made a appointment with the GP. When I contacted the surgery I was asked to come in that day and had an internal examination. The GP asked lots of questions and it seems that I have no other symptoms other than the bleeding which alternates between sticky dark brown and red, not very heavy though. My paternal grandmother died from womb cancer and my cousin had cervical cancer a few years ago.One thing of note is that I have had an upper back ache for a few months, usually starts at night, is really stiff but when I get up and move about it stops so likely unrelated. The GP tolD me she was referring to the hospital and wanted me to have blood test which I have booked in. The hospital rang me on Monday and asked me to attend 2 appointments, one on 14.12 for a scan and another in 23.12 but I have no idea what this is for. Can you ladies please share with me what symptoms you had, and from experience what I can expect at these appointments. Hubby wants to come with me but as I don’t really know what to expect I am kind of thinking this is routine and likely won’t need his support but if there is a possibility that I could be told at either of these appointments something could be wrong I think I’d like him to come with me. Any advice or experiences you could share will be appreciated.
Thank you, J

womb,Question,Sair72,Hysteroscopy,"
Hi,
I’ve just got back from having a hysteroscopy because I had some post menopausal bleeding on HRT. The ultrasound scan results  said that the endometrium was thickened at 7 mm. The cavity had a heterogeneous texture and was ill -defined.
Hence the appointment for the hysteroscopy. The nurse practitioner was very dismissive of my symptoms and almost suggested it was a waste of time. It was over so quickly and to me she didn’t really spend much time looking at the inside of the uterus. Then took the biopsy. Can they really tell everything is normal in such a short about of time? I didn’t come away feeling confident about her opinion. Has anyone have an experience this this? Thank you so much for taking time to help. Xx

womb,Question,,Wanting support and opinions,"
Hi, my first time on here. So  I was diagnosed with endometrial cancer 6 months ago but was told surgery wasn't an option.  The reason given at the time was to do with the cancer having spread outwards into the abdomen.  I had had no obvious symptoms,  no pain or bleeding so it was a complete shock when a CT scan given because of fluid build up showed the position.  I was told only option was chemotherapy and was given two choices of either one drug or two, the latter would be more aggressive involving hair loss etc. The Consultant suggested trying the less aggressive course on the basis that if it worked then I wouldn't have put myself through the additional trauma. The course finished in October followed by a further scan. I went for results Monday but only to be told it hadn't worked and there is now evidence of a lesion on my liver and a small growth on a kidney tube. Very shocked and I found the Consultant rather dismissive when I mentioned the other drug I could have he basically implied it would be pointless and I should think about my quality of life ( however long that might be) etc. I came away feeling numb but since then I've spoken to the clinical nurse specialist and I've come to the conclusion that even if additional chemo only has a 0.5% chance of working I owe it to myself and family to try. It will be 9 weekly sessions altogether.  However I'm now questioning their decision to not carry out surgery and have not had an answer that convinces me they were right. I've asked to speak to one of the surgeons if possible being as they are part of the MDT making the decisions. Has anyone else been in this position? Is it worth asking for a second opinion. Am I doing the right thing in going for the additional chemo? I would start this in the New Year so I can have a break first. 
Thank you for taking the time to read.

womb,Question,cbwc,Struggling again - reaching out to any stage 3 warriors,"
Hi everyone,
I'm a week post op and results of staging back today. I am devastated. Stage 3b ( was expecting 1 or 2). It was found on one side of cervix too and some question now about a genetic condition. 
Feel like I'm sinking. Can't take it in.
Has anyone had same stage and got through the other side? I  really need some positivity today. I feel like I've been given a death sentence. 
The thought of my children going through life without a mum makes my blood run cold.

womb,Question,SunflowerSeed2,Pre-operative assessment for Hysteroectomy,"
Hi,
My mum has been diagnosed with endometrial cancer in August. Things seem to have been moving quickly and have been given a date for laparoscopic surgery in a couple of weeks. She has been asked to attend for an exercise test as part of the pre-operative assessment but is worried as her fitness levels aren’t great, given she has an underlying lung condition which she takes steroids for and a raised BMI. She’s concerned they simply will not operate on her if she fails it so I was wondering if anyone has had any experience with this? I understand the tests are needed to check if her body is at risk of serious complications and the best anaesthetic approach for her. But what exactly does it entail?
Thanks in advance x

womb,Question,Bonnie B,After effects - bloating - magnesium side effect?,"
Hi
I haven’t been on to chat since my chemo stopped after three sessions due to side effects requiring me to be admitted to cancer unit twice after two sessions and in for a day after one session. I thought things would settle down. My oncologist said chemo was precautionary as was proposed radiotherapy which he decided we shouldn’t do because of my IBS. So I had my laparoscopic hysterectomy in March.  I am happy to be seeing him for check ups. The first being tomorrow.  
while getting back to normal I had regular breast screening where they picked up a 14mm tumour. Thankfully not connected to my endometrial cancer. However two weeks ago I had a lumpectomy and go for pathology results on 8th Nov. I’m hoping since it was so small nothing more will be needed. 
My IBS has been giving me a lot of problems - I think possibly due to magnesium supplement I am on because my levels went down while on chemo. I have stomach cramps, need to ‘go’ several times on waking and abdomen feels distended. I will ask if it is magnesium when I see him tomorrow, but wonder if anyone else has had same effect?

I had my first chemo a week ago and it has not been an easy road. First day and a half I felt fine then the pain kicked in followed by nausea, constipation, exhaustion and numbness in my fingers and toes. The pain is absolutely excruciating but is def getting better and now I have diarrhoea. I’m exhausted and emotionally drained and beginning to wonder if I can do this another five times. I hate to sound like a wimp and I have always been a get on with it type of person but this is a whole different ball game.  I was expecting side effects but all mine seem to be extreme. I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced this and if they did what happened treatment wise etc and did the side effects improve any? I was told side effects would get worse with every treatment so now I’m worried about what’s still to come. Don’t want to alarm anyone waiting to start treatment as their journey will probably be different to mine

womb,Question,,Hysteroscopy Referral,"
Hey everyone, I'm new here and so fed up and cross.
I saw a gynaecologist 8 days ago after previously seeing one and having an inconclusive biopsy.  She was unable to perform a biopsy at all so promised me she'd do a referral for a scan and hysteroscopy and that I wouldn't be waiting long.  My letter came today and my date is the 10th March 2022! 5 months!!
My mum had womb cancer which my GP and gynae know, I've lost 2 stone, have very over regular periods <21 days, am anaemic, hair loss, lethargy, pelvic pain, lower back pain and now severe joint pain. I know I'm not well but I need to know what I'm dealing with. I'm 45, a single mum (one of my daughters has additional needs) and I feel like I'm being fobbed off because I'm ""young"".
By the time my appointment comes round it will be a year since I started having tests (cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, blood tests, menopause tests, sti tests - all perfectly fine).
Should I push my GP/gynae to get me a date sooner or should I just sit in a & e and refuse to move until I have answers. I honestly can't go on much longer feeling how I do.

womb,Question,nightingale19,Longterm fatigue after hysterectomy,"
I had a total hysterectomy in November 2019 (stage 1a grade 3 clear cell) followed by 4 rounds of brachytherapy in January 2020.  I felt very tired afterwards with no drive and assumed it was the radiotherapy. When I next got to speak to my oncologist it was on the phone during the pandemic. He said my fatigue and loss of  drive were most likely due to lockdown and insufficient exercise and fresh air. And if I had any concerns to talk to my cancer nurses. I have to say that although my surgery was excellent, everybody on the nursing side including the cancer nurses have  always seemed rushed off their feet and been far too busy to talk to ""cured"" patients.  My GP is a waste of space.
To date I am happily in remission but my energy levels remain very low, and I have no drive which is not like me. I sleep badly.  There was a lot going on at home in the last year and I put fatigue and insomnia down to that. But things have eased  up lately and I am  slowly sleeping more  although I do not sleep easily. I still have no energy or drive. At all. So I began to wonder if it was hormone related and caused by  loss of my ovaries. Despite being in my 70s I had definite hot flushes after the operation. 
I saw a different oncologist for my latest checkup last month. When he examined me, he said my vagina entrance was very dry. He said normally he would recommend hormonal treatment for this but he could not in my case because this might contribute to womb cancer. I had been planning to ask him  about  taking bio identical hormones to supplement the loss of my ovaries. His comment ruled that out. 
Has anyone else had similar fatigue problems? Are there any natural remedies which might help my energy levels?

I had a total hysterectomy in November 2019 (stage 1a grade 3 clear cell) followed by 4 rounds of brachytherapy in January 2020.  I felt very tired afterwards with no drive and assumed it was the radiotherapy. When I next got to speak to my oncologist it was on the phone during the pandemic. He said my fatigue and loss of  drive were most likely due to lockdown and insufficient exercise and fresh air. And if I had any concerns to talk to my cancer nurses. I have to say that although my surgery was excellent, everybody on the nursing side including the cancer nurses have  always seemed rushed off their feet and been far too busy to talk to ""cured"" patients.  My GP is a waste of space.
To date I am happily in remission but my energy levels remain very low, and I have no drive which is not like me. I sleep badly.  There was a lot going on at home in the last year and I put fatigue and insomnia down to that. But things have eased  up lately and I am  slowly sleeping more  although I do not sleep easily. I still have no energy or drive. At all. So I began to wonder if it was hormone related and caused by  loss of my ovaries. Despite being in my 70s I had definite hot flushes after the operation. 
I saw a different oncologist for my latest checkup last month. When he examined me, he said my vagina entrance was very dry. He said normally he would recommend hormonal treatment for this but he could not in my case because this might contribute to womb cancer. I had been planning to ask him  about  taking bio identical hormones to supplement the loss of my ovaries. His comment ruled that out. 
Has anyone else had similar fatigue problems? Are there any natural remedies which might help my energy levels?

womb,Question,,Does anyone take vagifem oestrogen?,"
Hello, i had total hysterectomy 5 months ago, and was diagnosed with grade1 stage 1a adenocarcinoma. So thankfully, i believe, it was caught early. I have a question about hrt. Although 59, i believe menopause only began about a yr or 18 months ago according to my gp. Didnt really notice much at the time, but i sure do now. Ive had a number of UTIs lately, and my GP diagnosed vaginal atrophy and prescribed vagifem, a local oestrogen pessary to be used vaginally twice a week. However, when i went to the chemist with the prescription, she advised me against using it and said it could cause the cancer to return! So im terrified to touch it now! Im guessing if local oestrogen is a no-no ill have to rethink my plan of maybe going to see a menopause specialist about actually getting hrt patch as i suppose thats off the cards now as well. Has anyone used vagifem or indeed hrt patches? Thanks for any advice.

womb,Question,JoSB,appointment with oncologist to discuss adjuvent radiotherapy,"
Hi all, well its two weeks now since I got the great news that my scan over my body were clear ! Yeh I was on cloud 9. So it looks in so far as everyone can tell that the results of the biopsy post hysterectomy are Stage 1B grade 1 which is great but with LVSI.
I'm so glad that as the gynae oncologist that saw me said 'its highly treatable and very curable' However because (I think) of the LVSI raising the risk of re occurrence I'm being recommended a 5 week course of external radio therapy and going to see an oncologist on 8th October.
I have to say I've loads of questions because the gynae oncologist I saw at first said they may or may not decide to do radiation and if they do recommend it I should listen carefully to the stats that the oncologist will give me and weigh up the associated risks against the reduction of re occurrence that the radiotherapy would give against the risks. I was grateful but surprised she said this as I have to say I think I would have just accepted I had to have it. When I asked her more she said that the decision to have it often depended on the person - whether they felt that they could cope with the slightly added risk or not but not risk  potential side effects from the therapy.
I have to say this has left me very thoughtful and I've tried to find out as much as I can. It seems that whilst the radiotherapy in a case like mine at the grade and stage it is does reduce the risk of local re occurrence it doesnt seem to have an effect on long term survival rates. However when the nurse specialist rang with my appointment she said that the oncologist I was going to see advocates radiotherapy full stop. So it appears there are slightly differing opinions.
Sooo I've rather a long list of questions to ask when I go for my appointment and somehow I'll have to make a decision. Difficult because on the one hand of course I want to reduce the risk of re occurrance but on the other hand I feel fit and healthy, am in the early stages of a lovely new relationship, have a demanding job which I enjoy, am very active,and really wouldn't be good at coping with any bad long term effects of the radio therapy if they affected my quality of life. I guess I have to ask all my questions, and weigh it all up.
I was just wondering if any of you lovely people on here had had a similar grade of cancer with LVSI and faced the same decision? All thoughts greatly appreciated lol

womb,Question,Nonentity,Hysteroscopy,"
I've been  referred for an urgent appointment  for a hysteroscopy with biopsy and I'm dreading it - I'm very scared.  The gynaecologist said the biopsy should be done the sooner the better, so she tried to take the biopsy a couple of days ago, after she did a smear, but she couldn't get through the cervix as it's so tightly closed. The pain was really awfuI and I bled a lot as I'm on Warfarin.  I intend taking co codamol an hour before, so I'm hoping that will help.  Does anyone have any other suggestions - or reassurance? I want to get it over with, do I'm really hoping I cope ok.
For a bit if background  I'm 59, my last period was 21 years ago when I was 38. I have significant thickening of the lining of the uterus (shown on transvaginal ultrasound and CT scan) and have had intermittent  watery/brown staining on my underwear for a while. I also have a 6.5cm cyst on my right ovary, which I believe is going to monitored. My investigations for malignancy were originally started bu another hospital consultant as I had large unprovoked blood clots on both lungs  which may be due to hidden malignancy.

I had an open, total hysterectomy 4 weeks ago. I have leiomyosarcoma which is a very rare and aggressive cancer. I had an abdominal CT which was clear and I am having a chest CT on Saturday to check for any spread and I'm seeing a sarcoma consultant at the Christie hospital in Manchester at the beginning of September. 
My problem is that every time I eat I can only manage a couple of bites and don't have any appetite anyway. I have lost over 16lb since the op. I am overweight so it isn't too serious but I feel exhausted and light headed. Within an hour of eating I have horrendous diarrhoea and I am doubled over in pain. I have non alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver and don't take painkillers as they cause damage to the liver but I'm having to take codeine and use hot water bottles on my back and stomach. I'm worried that I won't ever be able to eat proper food again. Has anyone gone on to be unable to eat after a hysterectomy?. I can occasionally manage a single piece of toast but not eating proper food isn't good for my liver or type 2 diabetes.
Any advice would be welcomed. Deb

womb,Question,Samanthi,Treatment dilemma,"
Hello everyone,
I was diagnose with a 2.2 womb cancer in May, and I had a radical hysterectomy, loads of lymph nodes, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix and top of my vagina removed, with a long midline cut.  I'm six weeks post surgery, and healing well - my biopsies (lymph nodes and ovaries) were negative of any signs of cancer.  Prior to surgery, I was advised that if the biopsies were negative, I wouldn't need additional treatment, but following surgery, I have been advised that I need five weeks of external radiotherapy, and two weeks of internal radiotherapy, just to mop up any stray cells. My surgeon was very pleased with the surgery, and said he was 100% confident that he got everything out, with good margins.  Actually, I was surprised to hear him say that!
The dilemma I have, is that the radiologist has told me that I will 100% get vaginal scarring, narrowing and dryness, and also some degree of bladder and bowel scarring, because they cannot avoid hitting those areas with the radiotherapy. They say it's a question of how badly I will be affected, and how long, and the worst case scenario is that I could end up with surgery to remove scar tissue from my bladder, and a colostomy bag.  They have said that most of these effects will be a result of the external radiotherapy, but they want to do internal radiotherapy, to treat the top of the birth canal, where it is most likely to grow back.  I'm going to have the internal radiotherapy, but I am thinking of declining the external radtiotherapy, because there is a high degree of certainty that I will get bladder and bowel continence issues, and they keep reminding me that they aren't actually treating anything, and it seems to me, a risk that I am not sure I want to take. They also want to zap the area where my lymph nodes were, so have advised me that I would be at an even higher risk of lymphodema.
I haven't made up my mind fully. I'm not here to ask anyone to tell me what to do, but I'm just wondering if anyone has experience of having a combination of internal and external radiotherapy, where they haven't been able to avoid damage to the bowel and bladder too, or if anyone has any thoughts they would feel happy to share? I will have the internal radiotherapy - it's the external that I am thinking about declining.
Thank you for any thoughts,
With kindest wishes

womb,Question,nannyjanet,My Dilemma,"
I am 5 weeks after total Hysterectomy and I have had my call from Oncology today, they confirmed Cancer was 1a serous. and all indications are showing clear including nodes and Omentum .etc. which is good  However as it is Serous type and known to be aggressive with propensity to come back there is the offer of follow on treatment of Chemotherapy mix of Paclitraxel and Carboplatin or Brachytherapy . The dilemma comes with the fact that as it's early stage 1a they are giving me the choice to go ahead or not. the only reason to proceed appears to be based on preventing a recurrence in the future though this still doesn't give any guarantee...I admit this has put me in a bit of a stew and I have debated with myself over and over again, and I just don't know what to do. I had prepared myself to follow their advice and their recommendations whatever the outcome, I just wasn't expecting to have to decide for myself. I have already decided to accept treatment in some form , one or the other. my argument is swinging from Brachytherapy as far fewer ( if any) side effects but it will be targeted to just my Vagina.

womb,Question,Mamaden,OP DONE SO WHY AM I STILL SCARED?,"
Hi, 
I joined back in May as I had been diagnosed with womb cancer & was due to have a full hysterectomy.
Well I had it on June 10th & according to the Dr they got it all and the cancer has gone, but I’m to have a review in 3 months.
Friends & family are all over the moon for me and yes of course it’s good news, so why am I so scared? I keep thinking it’s going to appear somewhere else, the thoughts are so real I’m not eating or sleeping properly. Is it normal to feel like this? Am I likely to get it somewhere else?
I have my routine mammogram on Monday & I’m terrified that they’re going to find something even though I feel no changes when I examine myself.
Thank you if you’ve read this far, I’m just so scared & confused.

womb,Question,Deborino,So painful,"
I almost didn't come back to the forum as it turns out that I don't have cancer after all. I was diagnosed with a cancerous fibroid and told that I needed a total hysterectomy. I had my open surgery on the 13th July and was told that it wasn't cancerous. I still haven't had my histology back but I'm not expecting it to be bad news. I left hospital two days after my op but went back in the day after as I was in so much pain. I have liver disease which means I can't take strong painkillers. I stayed in for another two days and they did a CT as every time I emptied my bladder or bowel it was excruciating. It felt like my bladder was spasming. There weren't any collections so it seems that it's due to the excessive adhesions from my previous c.sections which needed a lot of resecting during the hysterectomy. I am still struggling with the pain which doesn't seem to be getting any easier. Any advice? Deb

womb,Question,Deborino,Advice please,"
I should have had my hysterectomy last Tuesday but due to my blood sugar levels being too high it was postponed until next Tuesday 13th July. I only had the tinyest  spot of blood at the diagnosis of a cancerous fibroid. I bled for over two weeks after the biopsy which was on the 19th may and nothing since. I have suddenly started to bleed like a period today. I don't know what to do. I think if I ring the hospital they will just say you're having surgery in a week so leave it. What do you think? Deb

womb,Question,,Staging after 3 cycle of chemotherapy.,"
Hi everyone,
I just had a scan last week after my chemotherapy. Now I have a meeting with Oncologist this week. I’m  getting nervous and anxious with hope that chemotherapy has worked so far. Losing hair, weight loss and painful body, my whole life changed but hope is still there. Women with womb and breast cancer that I’ve heard or seen, so vulnerable so easy and so quickly spreading without knowing and adding a full stop to our lives. I pray every day and pray for all those women suffering into this painful journey.   Could anyone please share your experience after 3 cycles of chemotherapy for womb cancer? Thank you

womb,Advice,Jigsaw33,Smear tests after hysterectomy,"
Someone on the forum was asking about smear tests, and do you still need to attend if you’ve had a hysterectomy.  A lot of us here are past the age where we are offered tests anyway, but  I think the answer is, you need to check with your team. The general advice seems to be the following:


Most hysterectomies involve the removal of the cervix and then there is no further need for cervical cancer screening.




However, sometimes a hysterectomy is performed where part or all of the cervix remains and those women should remain on the screening programme if they are within the eligible age range.


Hope this is useful advice for our younger members.

womb,Question,,Any Hysterectomy advise?,"
Hey all!
ive recently been told (Monday) that my cancer is back and I’m being booked in for the hysterectomy. Do you have any advise? Or thing/tips you wish were told before going in?
I’m 27, was previously of the hormone fertility saving treatment (for about a year and 1/2) to reduce the cancer, followed on by a year ‘off’ treatment trying to get pregnant. Truthfully I thought everything was going fine, my body finally started having regular periods (hasn’t done that since I was a teen) so was hoping I’d be pregnant before the end of the year! Have no children, so trying for our first!my last hysteroscopy/ biopsy came back suspicious- so they sent me for an additional biopsy and MRI. Called in on Monday to discuss the results, already knew it was bad news when the nurse was waiting for me at the door. Cancer is back and now slightly higher grade (trying to spread its love?), still contained in the womb so I know how lucky I am- but can’t help feeling gutted!
im not too sure on the time scales, or what to expect! They’re hoping to do it via keyhole- and leaving my ovaries. Just taking the womb and tubes. Any advise on what to expect would be incredibly helpful, definitely freaking out a bit here!

womb,Question,Lucki2021,What happens after chemo and after the 2 year immunotherapy drug ends?,"
Hello Ladies

Hope you all well

i was wondering if I could ask for your help please and guidance?

My mum is due to have her last round of chemo in three weeks time.  She had a hysterectomy about 3 years ago with radiotherapy.   Unfortunately it’s returned in her pelvic lymph nodes and para ortic lymph lymph nodes.
I read the prognosis and had a complete wobble but you have all supported me and given me encouragement not to google things too much!

we think mum is also on an immunotherapy drug trial which is a trial for 2 years 
so far the scan from last month shows that the chemo is working     Some of the lymph nodes have shrunk significantly so we are all praying that the progress continues...and the nasty cells are banished away...

my question relates to what happens when the trial comes to an end?   Will that be it or will they continue to offer the immunotherapy drug?

any info/guidance given gratefully received 
Lots of love to you all and best wishes xxx ️️️️

She is 67 years old, obese but loosing weight constantly as she has been on a great diet for a year, high cholesterol.

womb,Question,Deborino,Cancer or not,"
I am 61 and about 2 years ago I was diagnosed with non alcoholic cirrhosis. This came as a huge shock as I have never really been much of a drinker. It was discovered during my yearly diabetes blood tests that I was severely anaemic. From the end of August last year until boxing Day I was admitted to hospital due to eosphegeal bleeding 8 times. It was horrible and frightening. I am due to have my yearly abdominal scan this Thursday. This is to check for liver cancer. I had unexpected bleeding ten years ago and had an internal ultrasound which showed that I had lots of fibroids but I was given the all clear and nothing has happened since until now. I had finished my menopause when I was 43.
Last Tuesday I started having really bad pain in my stomach, back and into my groin. I called my GP who said to go to A and E as it could be pancreatitis which I had 11 years ago. The senior nurse practitioner said that I had blood in my urine and it was a kidney stone and sent me home with codein and told to return if things got worse. I noticed some pink stained mucus but thought it was due to the kidney stone. By 3pm I had to go back to the hospital. This time they sent me to the surgical assessment dept. I then had an CT scan at 2am as they thought it may be appendicitis. They then said that there was a cyst on my uterus and passed me on to gynae. I had an internal ultrasound and internal examination. The next day I had a biopsy and the consultant said it could be a fibroid extending outside the uterus or endometrial cancer. I will get the results in the next two weeks and have an MRI within two weeks.
I am in bits. It is going round and round my head and I can't concentrate on anything else. I thought my life was a bit rubbish before with my cirrhosis but now I feel like I have no control over it.

womb,Question,Deborino,The waiting is the worst thing.,"
I've previously posted about my ongoing diagnosis. I was contacted by the consultants secretary the other day who told me I needed to have a hysteroscopy tomorrow (Friday) today she rang again and said that they'd decided that I shouldn't have it done and have the MRI on Tuesday as planned. I asked if my biopsy results were back and she told me that they were and my case would be discussed on Fridays MDT. This set off alarm bells with me. She asked if I would like someone to ring me to discuss the biopsy results and I said yes. I am going to ring the secretary tomorrow and emphasise that I need to speak to the consultant. I get the impression that they really want to see the MRI results before discussing the biopsy. I know that none of you are doctors but do you think that cancelling the hystoscopy is a bit of a give away? I am still bleeding since the biopsy last Friday. In fact I coughed the other night and I had a massive flood of blood, it was pouring down my legs. It slowed down later and.its now like a regular period. I was told after the procedure that I'd experience light spotting for a couple of days.

womb,Question,DiEB,Lymphoedema problems,"
Hi everyone 
It's been 6 weeks now since my BSO, Pelvic lymphadenectomy operation for Grade 3 Womb cancer. As far as the Op is concerned I feel I've recovered quite well.  The problem I have now is the discomfort of swellings caused by Lymphoedema which appeared about 10 days after the op. It affects my lower pelvic area, groin, left leg and foot which, of course, is due to the removal of my pelvic lymph nodes. At my post op appointment I was told that this problem might (hopefully) sort itself out, but I was referred to the Lymphoedema Service for support and advice and I have since had a telephone assessment with a helpful nurse who is arranging an appointment at a local clinic. I wondered if anyone else has had similar problems. 
Yesterday I had an appointment at the Oncology Clinic and my Brachytherapy treatment plan was explained which I was told will commence in about 2 weeks time. The doctor informed me that if my lymph nodes had not been removed I would be having far more extensive radiotherapy due to my Grade 3 cancer whereas I am now only having 3 Brachytherapy sessions. 
I would love to hear if anyone has had similar problems. Thanks.

I had an upset tummy last night & had quite bad diahorrea, it’s eased up now but I’m bleeding again, this time it actually looks like a period (last time was light pink) I also have slight period cramps. It’s only when I wipe & not in my underwear, is this to be expected or should I call the hospital tomorrow & tell them? I’m scared it’s getting worse.

womb,Question,Mamaden,NOT YET DIAGNOSED BUT WORRIED AND SCARED.,"
Hi,
I had a uterus biopsy 2 weeks ago as I had an abnormal bleed (I'm 60). It wasn't for long, about 5-10 minutes, wasn't heavy but came with the old period pains I used to get.
I was told at the biopsy that results can take 3 weeks, after 2 weeks I recevied a call saying I had a 2nd appointment to discuss my results for this Friday May 7th. so 2 weeks after the biopsy. Today I have received a call to say that the gynecology department have referred me for an MRI scan which is also this Friday. None of the departments will discuss anything over the phone so I waswondering if anyone can help me with what the chances are I have cancer? I have no other symptons and have only had the one bleed. I am scared to the point that I cannot talk to anyone as I am really tearful so thought maybe someone on here could help with maybe what the chances are of this being cancer seeing as I have been called back within 2 weeks.  Sorry if I am rambling and sorry that my question isn't as important as those of you who have been diagnosed, I just don't know who else to ask.
Thank you.

womb,Question,,Query about frequency of CT scans after treatment,"
Hello, I was wandering if anyone can advise me on the frequency of CT scans after treatment?

After a full hysterectomy and treatment (Chemotherapy, Radiotherapy + Brachytherapy) for Stage 3, Grade 3b Endometrial Cancer - my first after treatment CT scan showed no sign of cancer, which is such a relief.
My Oncologist (who is different to the one I had throughout my treatment last year) has scheduled my next appointment in May (which I think will involve examination). However he said my next CT scan would not be until a years time. I told him that I was under the impression that I would be having a CT scan every four months after my treatment finishes. But he said I would be having a CT scan once a year.
I queried this again a couple of weeks later and I had the same response again. This time I was advised it was only during the treatment that I was having my CT scans every four months. I am so relieved that my recent CT scan was clear but I am concerned as to having just one CT scan a year...especially in light of how advanced my cancer was.

My husband was diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2015 and he had one session of Chemotherapy (he was unable to complete the full sessions due to side effects). He had a CT scan twice every year for five years I think.

I can't but help thinking that I should be having more regular CT scans to ensure the cancer has not come back.

Any advice would be much appreciated.

Thank you.

womb,Question,,"Womb cancer has spread due to 12 week delay due to COVID, cancer now terminal.","
Hello everyone,
I am absolutely devastated to be here and would like as much help as I can.  I feel like my mum has been been given a death sentence by the NHS.  She is 65 years of age and started bleeding at the end of October.  She went straight to her doctor and was seen at the hospital within 2 weeks.  She was told on 22nd December that she had aggressive womb cancer which was contained and that she would need a hysterectomy ASAP.  In January we basically chased the hospital every week and was told that elective surgery was cancelled due to covid.  How can aggressive cancer be looked at as elective anyway?
We took her twice to A and E, as the bleeding got bad.  Both times, they checked her and sent us home, saying there was no reason to be concerned and the doctor said that she was absolutely certain it was contained.  She basically didn’t get her hysterectomy until 9th March and we got devastating news 2 days ago, saying that the cancer had spread and was in her ovaries, Fallopian tubes, omentum and she has spots on her peritoneum and she cannot be cured and is terminal.  They are doing 6 months of chemo, but we really don’t hold out much hope.
I am so angry, upset and have so many emotions going through.   Really can’t cope with this.  Please help.

Haven't managed too many walks so far.  Not too warm here in Scotland.  But am managing a little more each day.  How long have others waited for pathology results ?  My consultant said 3 - 4 weeks.

That appointment is on 12th April and I’m going into panic mode purely because I don’t have a clue what happens next if the test results are bad, and the little mind gremlins are playing with my thoughts and got me imagining the worst.  I’m wondering if I can still contact the nurse I was assigned when the womb cancer was first diagnosed even though my surgery is over and done with. I just need someone to chat to that can tell me what to expect, and lay these unhealthy thoughts to rest.

That was the 1st of March. Consultant said it could be up to 6 weeks before I hear anything back... I'm under NHS not private .... In the interim I found a lump on my breast & gp checked an am on fastrack for imaging etc. 
My question is how long did you wait for biopsy results for womb & cervix via NHS & how long for breast biopsy via NHS.
I have called gyny ward where hysteroscopy was done & they said they will try & get consultant to call me. I also asked nurse on here & she said it can take a while.
If anyone can comment that would be great on how long it took for womb cervical biopsies to come back versus breast biopsy.
Thanks X

womb,Question,Bella H,Update,"
Hi all,
apologies for the delay in getting in touch. It’s all been a bit of a mess. I had my abdominal surgery as planned last Tuesday. Late stage change to my surgeon. I ended up with two really lovely surons and anaesthetist. I had a spinal block in place before the operation which really helped with the pain post surgery. They attempted this 6 times until it was actually in place but it really wasn too bad. I woke up in recovery and then went up onto a ward. No pain really at all that evening and didn’t get out of bed. The surgeon came the next morning and said everything had gone really wellnd requested the nurses to get me out of bed before 12 and continue morphine to see how I get on then remove catheter. I quickly realised I was not on a gynae ward but a thoracic ward and the nurseseally didn’t know what they should have been doing with me. They removed my catheter and pain pump and 5pm and instructed me to get myself out of bed onto the chair. I did this and went completely dzy and fainted. I had not been up for a day and a half and no longer had pain killers. I ended up back in bed for the night and was given oral pain relief. The following day (Thursday)I was in severpain at the top part of my incision it felt like when I stood, walked or moved it was tearing the pain was so bad. This has continued since. On the first day I ate the food I had ordered from the me only to be told the day after by the surgeon that I should only be having a liquid diet. Everything seems to have gone so wrong. I now have been on movicol since Wednesday and have not yet opened mbowels. I am really worried about this and what is going to happen if I don’t go. All I have been eating since is cup a soups. The hospital just about got on top of pain medication today and got me mfortable but then the surgeon came and said my white blood cell count is 14000 which is too high so I can’t go home. I have really cried today. I’m in so much pain and so fed up. I just want to go me. Did anyone else have a high WBC and it went down? Xx

womb,Question,Jigsaw33,The dreaded dilators,"
Hi ladies, after a bit of advice here.
I had my hysterectomy in late August 2020 ( grade 1 stage 1b) followed by three sessions of brachytherapy, the last one was the beginning of November.  I was told I would need to use dilators to keep everything open, however I wasn’t given them until the beginning of February. I asked why, as the instructions say start within three weeks after brachytherapy and my CNS didn’t seem unduly worried and just said they had been very busy because of Covid etc. I had asked about them several times and was just told they would be in touch etc.  Anyway, in the meantime I was using a vibrator and we were also using the “natural method” rather unsuccessfully. 
So, my query is that I have been using them for a few weeks now, no problems until the last two times, when I take them out they come out with a bit of blood. It’s not on the tip, it comes out afterwards. I know the instructions warn you may get a bit of bleeding, but I’m just thinking it’s a bit odd that I had no problems at first, why am I starting to bleed now? Anyone else had this happen, do you think I should call up the CNS? Don’t want to bother them unduly, especially as they called me last week to check how I was both physically and mentally, such a support team they are fantastic.
Thanks for any info!

womb,Question,,Side Effects,"
Hello,
Unfortunately I have been unable to post for a while. Just been so tired with no energy. Its hard to believe that I did my first post on here almost a year ago and it was so reassuring to get the support I did 
I was hoping to get some advice about the side effects of my treatment. My Oncologist and GP are at a loss as to what is causing my unusual side effects....
Last December I had a Hysterectomy-this was due to a diagnosis of Stage 1a Endometrial Cancer. However it was in January (at my first Oncology appointment since the operation) that I was advised that it was actually Stage 3b, Grade 3 Endometrial Cancer. Due to the aggressiveness+advanced stage of the cancer- I had to undergo 4+half months of Chemotherapy, 6 weeks of Radiotherapy and 2 sessions of Brachytherapy.      My treatment finished in August 2020 and I had my first CT scan (since completion of treatment) at the beginning of this month.  I am awaiting the results of this.
I did initially experience pins+needles in my hands which was one of the side effects of the Chemotherapy, this has thankfully eased off abit. I have been advised that I have lymphodema in my legs and I have been given special stockings to wear for these. However one of the side effects I get and which the Oncologists/Doctors do not not what it is, is really starting to get me down. 
Its hard to describe but I get this funny sensation all over my body. It usually comes on when I am sleeping- its so strong that it wakes me up at night and I find it hard to get back to sleep. I also have tinnitus, which further adds to my trouble sleeping. I have been prescribed strong sleeping tablets but only temporarily, as they are very strong + addictive. But despite being strong, even these are now no longer working. I had 2 Reflexology treatments which I was hoping would provide some relief,  but no joy.
I was just wandering if anyone else has ever encountered side effects from treatment that their GP/Oncologist are unable to establish what it is? With my Doctors being at a loss as to what these funny sensations are, I am worried that these are permanent and that I will never be able to get a decent night's sleep again....
Any advice would be much appreciated.

Thank you

womb,Question,FlorrieMcWorrie,Newly diagnosed,"
I found out this week that I have stage 1 endometrial cancer. I had an appointment with the gynae surgeon and will be having a total laparoscopic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo oophorectomy, hopefully in the next month. The consultant showed me my MRI scan and commented that I have a very large bladder. He said that I might have problems afterwards and may need to self-catheterise for a time. That all sounds quite scary.
I am also concerned about my recovery post-op as I have an underlying rheumatological disease which has affected my muscles, making them very weak. My mobility is limited (I need to use crutches) and my core strength is also poor. I’m worried that it’s going to be hard for me to get going after surgery and also once I’m home. I’m not able to do a great deal at the moment and as I live on my own, I’m worried that it’s going to be a struggle.
How much discomfort do you get from a laparoscopic hysterectomy?

womb,Question,Bella H,Abdominal Hysterectomy,"
Hello again, i was diagnosed before Christmas with Grade 1 endometrial cancer. After an MRI scan it showed I had an abnormal mass/cyst on my right ovary and the other ovary didn’t look quite normal. They are not sure either way if this is the same cancer that has spread to the ovaries, ovarian cancer at the same time or if they are just cysts. I had a CT scan which showed no further spread and it looked like the cancer in the uterus had not spread much into the muscle wall and no sign of any lymph node involvement. I have just been told today that I am no longer having keyhole surgery as expected. They said I will be having abdominal surgery due to the questionable ovaries. They said they would need to take more out. I have never had an operation before and I had just about got my head around having keyhole surgery but now it is going to be a much bigger operation and will have to stay in hospital longer. The nurse said they needed to do it this way so they could get a real good look inside. I am still waiting to get an appointment to see a consultant to explain everything before surgery. They are expecting the surgery to be beginning of February unless I am called in before. Has anyone else had this kind of surgery? Really anxious about everything again today.  Thanks so much xx

Hi all I'm new to this forum,  last Thursday I visited my GP with concerns with continual bleeding in between my periods,horrific back pain   , light pinky discharge ... Gp examined me and straight away she referred me on a 2 w wait at my local gyne clinic... Gp expressed that I have a fleshy polyp growing out from my uterus and coming out of my cervix, GP did advise me she wanted a 2nd opinion, I was booked in for the very next day.. which in itself spooked me!  I attended the clinic as arranged,  a internal examination was performed by a female Dr, then suddenly Dr brought 2 male drs to examine her findings as what my GP had seen. The examination was painful , made me cry tbh... After examination I was told I need a emergency surgery to have my uterus looked at thoroughly, and for sample to be taken, that was it at that point !! I then really felt scared! I signed my consent forms there and then, was told I would be contacted for pre op then for a surgery date, .I was given mefamic acid for pain , off I went home.. feeling numb... As soon as I sat in the car I cried and cried...how can this be!!

As you can imagine my head is swimming with all this , is it cancer??? How had I not known I had a growth in my womb .. I can't sleep , how are we going to cope if it turns out to be cancer , someone please advice , if only to put my mind at ease .

womb,Question,Chrissy72,Grade 1 Stage 1b LVSI+ Treatment Quandry,"
Histology following my hysterectomy gave me the above diagnosis.  First consultation with Oncologist he said "" I am thinking outer radiotherapy"""" because of LVSI  He then asked what other problems I have.  One of them is a spinal condition.  He then said ""Brachytherapy should enough"".

Following this consultation I expressed my concerns that maybe I should have outer radiotherapy.  I was then referred for a CT scan followed by another consultation with ⁷Oncologist.  The CT scan showed Lymph Nodes are fine and he said f I was stage 2 or 3 he would definitely recommend outer radiotherapy and that Brachytherapy ""should be enough""

The CNS present explained  afterwards that there is always a chance that a tiny speck, unseen by the microscope, could still be present which obviously started niggles in the back off my head.

My question is:-  Has anyone else with Grade 1 Stage 1b LVSI+  opted for Brachytherapy only?  I know everyone's experience is different but it has been left for me to decide which treatment I proceed with.

She never wrote anything down.  When I left the hospital I never got any paper work on post op instructions or what would happen next.  So my initial diagnosis was given in the out patients and this appointment is in the clinic where I originally had my biopsies and scan etc.  It is also with another consultant not my original surgeon.  What I'm wondering is this a physical check of my cuff etc and is it normal routine that you have a follow up exam after surgery.  You can understand how panicked I am, I got lots of lovely reassurance of the Macmillan nurse but I'm wondering how many ladies went in for a follow up exam at the hospital?  Many thanks in advance x

womb,Question,Bella H,Awaiting MRI results anxiety,"
Hello, 
After a year of really heavy periods and light spotting between periods I was diagnosed with grade 1 Endometrial Cancer two weeks ago after a Hysteroscopy and biopsy. My smear test was clear.  I had an MRI scan on Wednesday to see if it has spread. I am absolutely terrified that the cancer will have spread. I tried my best to enjoy Christmas but it was so difficult to ignore the constant sick feeling in the pit of my  stomach. Over the last couple of days I have started to get a cystitis feeling when I go to the toilet and have now got a cough (negative covid test) this only adds to my worries that it could have spread. I did however feel quite well before my diagnosis other than my terrible periods. I am 37 and have no children. Did anyone else have the same anxieties when waiting for results or similar symptoms? I don’t know why I find it so hard to think positively. I should find out my results next week after my consultant has the MDT meeting.

Hi Ladies, I hope everyone is doing well. I got my Covid results today and they were negative so I’m off to hospital for surgery tomorrow. I was wondering if anyone could tell me whether it’s okay to take my regular co-codamol painkillers tomorrow morning as usual? I’m allowed a bit of toast at 7am and would be taking them then. I’ve tried contacting my CNS but got the answer machine. I’ve left a message in the hope she gets back to me before tomorrow morning. I’m just worried about my medication causing problems with whatever I need to have for surgery, or is this just the little beggar playing games with my head again and making me over cautious and worrying for nothing.  Thank you to everyone for all the help and support you have given me throughout this rollercoaster ride of a journey. Please take care of yourselves. I’ll pop back in once my surgery is done and dusted.

womb,Question,NewbieAndi,"Post-op, so what happens now?","
Hi again,
so as you know, I had my lap hysterectomy last Tuesday for endometrial cancer. I’m recovering ok, I think, but really not sure what happens now, what I should or should not be able to do by this stage. On discharge the nurse explained to me about wearing antiembolism socks for 2 weeks, 28 days of blood thinner injections and post-op pain relief. Apart from that I’ve had no other advice, I’ve not been offered a cancer nurse contact or given any real follow up information. I’m presuming the surgeon will contact me with my histology results, but have not been given a specific timescale or anything. As you can understand I’m freaking out a little bit, what stage cancer did I have, what further treatment will I need, or not need?
Is it normal to not have a cancer nurse contact or even support? I’ve got lots of questions spinning around in my head, but no one but this group to ask?

womb,Question,Dreamweaver,Long-term side effects of brachytherapy,"
MrsBJH's, and others', description of the process of brachytherapy, including use of dilators / vibrators, has been very reassuring. But as my first appointment for brachytherapy looms (on 11 December) I'm becoming more anxious about potential side effects of the treatment. My doctor indicated these were mostly minor and resolve over time, but my mind's been doing overtime as the date gets nearer. So I thought I'd ask all the wonderful women in this forum about their experience.I've suffered cystitis badly in the past and am not keen on long-term version (my mother's death certificate included urinary tract infection). Secondly, one of my scans to confirm endometrial cancer showed I have diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon (I'd been under the impression for years that I'd had a hiatal hernia - amazing some of the learning that comes of all my cancer treatment - they also found gallstones...). I've been told brachytherapy can irritate the bowel but is this long-term?
At 63 I'm also hoping to get my sex life back too (currently only 4 weeks' post TLH BSO so a while yet to go) but am beginning to feel hopeless about the future. Can anyone offer any reassurance? Are the side effects worth the reduction in recurrence rates? Thanks, and hugs to all,Dx

womb,Question,,Masks and Antibiotics,"
Hello everyone,
As the lead up to the date is getting closer,  I was lying awake last night thinking about the Covid thing and hospitals.
For any of those who have been in to have surgery recently, were you expected to have a mask on at all times?
Obviously I will be having the test before I go in but it got me thinking. Masks supposedly are to stop you spreading and not the other way round. Have you had to wear a mask after surgery?
Also, I was told that whilst in theatre I would be given antibiotics. I find this a little strange that they are given them as a what if instead of I actually need them. Has anyone told their surgeon that they don't want them before?
Thanks xxx

I am fully confused on all of this frankly. does this mean the cancer went to my nodes or lobes or whatever and also- since my CT came back clear am I in the clear for no spread in my body ??  I am realizing that the serous component of the tumor (which he said was 10%) is really the problem and if little microscope[ic cancers trailed off it I wouldn't even know. pathology is on tues. he said ""things are as good as they can be at this point"" and ""everything is a reassuring as it can be"" what the heck - then why dont I have a clue as to what is going on and if I am still in a curable zone! sorry to vent

I should be thankful for the CT and all the other signs that point in a good direction , but really tough to hear the word"". chemo"" . my friend told me about ""cold caps"" has anyone every used them and do they work?

womb,Question,,Quick question,"
Hi everyone 
Sorry to bother you with what is probably a stupid question, but I was wondering if you could help. As most of you know I’m waiting on surgery date confirmation and I was wondering if it’s more likely to be by telephone or letter? I had to go out into the garden yesterday for some air and save me going stir crazy  (I’ve been trying to stay in, just in case) and thought I heard the phone but didn’t get back inside in time to catch it.
I guess the waiting zone is getting to me (again) as I woke up at 4:30am this morning worrying that I’d missed a phone call because I forgot to put the answer machine on and had missed my chance at a November date.  I know I’m being totally idiotic, and I just have to be patient but it’s getting harder and harder as time goes by. I really hate how this little beggar plays with your mind. 
Hope everyone is in good spirits and that anyone with procedures coming up have a successful outcome. 
Take Care
Angie‍

womb,Question,SparklyFireworks,Weeping wound - nearly 3 weeks post op,"
Just wondering if anyone else has had this?
I had keyhole with 5 incisions and the one above belly button has been more uncomfortable since the op. Hardly aware of others. 
2.5 weeks as after op, it got really itchy, and I resisted somehow, but Saturday the skin glue had split and then I noticed a tiny bit of weeping fluid where glue coming away from wound. No smell. No more pain than the feeling I've had since op, which is occasionally uncomfortable, but it kind of gets scrunched up when I sit/slouch.
Today I've put a dressing on as it seemed a tiny bit overnight and made a mess of my nightie.
Will phone ward and/or GP in morning, but wondered if anyone else had same - very small discharge from wound, this far after op with no smell, almost skin coloured - pale creamy colour (I'm pasty white!).

womb,Question,Tippybailey,Granular tissue biopsy / sentinel node contaminated during surgery ?,"
Hi everyone,
ok so I had my 3 month check yesterday and whilst being examined they took a biopsy of granulated tissue. I’m now panicking at that.
Also they said a tiny bit of cancer on sentinel node, but after the “meeting “ of my team they came to conclusion this was likely contaminated during surgery.
Does this sound right ? I questioned them and they seem quite relaxed about it all . I don’t need any further treatment .
just another wait for the biopsy.
hope everyone is ok xx

womb,Question,,Radiotherapy,"
Hi everyone.
I had my surgery 2 weeks ago and recovery is going ok.
I had my follow up on 16th and they told me that I have stage 2 cancer and they said that they got it all in the removal of the womb etc.
They said that radiotherapy would be the next port of call once I have healed fully from the surgery but something I didnt realise was that its a 1 time only thing.
The doctor said I could save the radiotherapy if the cancer returns there but I'm in a dilemma as to whether to have radio now as an extra kick up the cancers bum.
There is cancer in our familys genetics because I lost my sister to breast cancer when she was 37.
I have an app to discuss the radiotherapy and also the histology but I don't know what questions to ask them in order to help my decision.
If theres anyone that can help me with poss questions to ask then please let me know as I have my app on weds this week and its short notice because I only got the call this afternoon offering me the appointment.

Due the spread to lymph nodes and possibly to lungs; I can’t have surgery yet, but if chemotherapy works then possibly a surgery can be done.if anyone knows anything about above treatment, can you write that to me because all I can read is about surgery and chemotherapy or radiotherapy unlike I wasn’t offered such treatment. Everything happened so quick, I have nothing except to pray and pray. Hope
